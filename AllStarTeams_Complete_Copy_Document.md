### Step 2-2: Star Strengths Self-Assessment
**Content Type:** Assessment Modal

**About this assessment:**
The AllStarTeams Strengths Assessment helps you discover your unique strengths profile across five key dimensions: Thinking, Acting, Feeling, Planning, and Imagining.

• 22 short questions about how you approach work and collaboration
• Takes approximately 10–15 minutes to complete
• You'll order your responses from most like you (1) to least like you (4)
• Generates your personal Star Card—a visual snapshot of your strengths

**Instructions:**
For each scenario, drag and drop the four options to rank them from most like you (1) to least like you (4).

• There are no right or wrong answers—just be honest about what feels true to you.
• The four core strengths are quantified, color-coded, and placed on your Star Card based on your responses.
• Your fifth strength, Imagination, is not ranked or measured here. It appears at the top of your Star Card—blank like a canvas, symbolizing your unique potential.

**What you'll get:**
Your personal Star Card, showing how your four core strengths are distributed and ordered.

• Think, Act, Feel, and Plan are placed on the card based on how you use them.
• Imagination appears at the apex, as your limitless fifth strength.

Later in the course, you'll complete your Star Card by adding your Flow State Qualities, making it a powerful tool for personal and team development.
