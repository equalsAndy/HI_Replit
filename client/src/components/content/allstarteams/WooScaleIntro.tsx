            If you've never heard the term <strong>"woo-woo"</strong>, try saying it out loud while gently waving your hands in the air.
            <br />
            That's basically the vibe.
            <br />
            It's a tongue-in-cheek way people describe anything that feels mystical, spiritual, or just a little too "floaty" â€” like energy talk, horoscopes, crystals, or even meditation.

            But here, woo-woo isn't an insult or a belief system.
            <br />
            It's a <strong>metaphor</strong> â€” a playful way to explore how each of us relates to imagination, intuition, and ideas that don't come with lab results attached.
