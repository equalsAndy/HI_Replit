## Scoring Algorithm
1. User ranks 4 options for each question (1-4, most to least like them)
2. Points assigned: Rank 1 = 3pts, Rank 2 = 2pts, Rank 3 = 1pt, Rank 4 = 0pts
3. Points summed by category across all 22 questions
4. Final scores converted to percentages totaling 100%
5. Results determine Star Card quadrant placement

## Technical Implementation
- Source file: `client/src/data/assessmentQuestions.ts`
- Interface: `AssessmentQuestion` and `AssessmentOption`
- Scoring logic: `client/src/lib/assessmentScoring.ts`
- Category validation ensures balanced representation across all strength areas
