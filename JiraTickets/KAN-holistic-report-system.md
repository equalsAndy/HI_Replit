# KAN - Holistic Report System for AST Workshop

**Issue Type:** Epic  
**Project:** KAN  
**Priority:** High  
**Reporter:** Claude Code  
**Date Created:** 2025-01-27  

## Summary
Build a comprehensive holistic report system that generates personalized development reports for users after completing the AllStarTeams (AST) workshop, integrating with the workshop progression system to unlock step 5-2.

## Description
Users need a meaningful, beautifully designed holistic report that synthesizes their entire AST workshop journey into actionable insights for personal and professional development. The report should honor privacy boundaries while providing deep insights into strengths, flow states, and growth pathways.

The system should generate reports using mock data initially (Phase 1), with Claude API integration planned for future enhancement (Phase 2). The report becomes available when users complete the workshop and answers are locked, triggering the unlock of step 5-2 in the workshop progression.

## User Story
**As a** workshop participant  
**I want** to receive a comprehensive holistic report of my strengths and development journey  
**So that** I can understand my unique profile and have a clear roadmap for continued growth

**As an** administrator  
**I want** reports to be generated automatically upon workshop completion  
**So that** users receive immediate value and the workshop flow progresses smoothly

## Technical Implementation Plan

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Add report tracking table
CREATE TABLE holistic_reports (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  report_data JSONB NOT NULL,
  generated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  status VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'generated',
  pdf_file_path VARCHAR(500),
  pdf_file_size INTEGER,
  pdf_file_name VARCHAR(255),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Update user progress to track report availability
ALTER TABLE user_workshop_progress 
ADD COLUMN holistic_report_generated BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN holistic_report_id UUID REFERENCES holistic_reports(id);

-- Index for efficient file lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_holistic_reports_user_id ON holistic_reports(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_holistic_reports_status ON holistic_reports(status);
```

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// Generate PDF report for user
POST /api/reports/holistic/generate
// Get report metadata
GET /api/reports/holistic/:userId
// Download PDF file
GET /api/reports/holistic/:userId/pdf
// Preview PDF in browser
GET /api/reports/holistic/:userId/preview
// Regenerate report
POST /api/reports/holistic/:userId/regenerate
// Check generation status
GET /api/reports/holistic/:userId/status
```

### Component Structure
```
client/src/components/reports/
├── HolisticReportViewer.tsx    // Main PDF viewer component
├── ReportDownload.tsx          // Download and preview controls
├── ReportLoading.tsx           // Loading states during PDF generation
├── ReportError.tsx             // Error handling for generation failures
└── utils/
    ├── reportTypes.ts          // TypeScript interfaces
    └── pdfUtils.ts             // PDF viewing utilities

server/src/services/
├── reportGenerator.ts          // PDF generation service
├── mockDataService.ts          // Mock data provider
├── pdfService.ts              // PDF creation and storage
└── fileStorage.ts             // File system/cloud storage management
```

### PDF Storage Strategy
```typescript
// File naming convention
// reports/holistic/[userId]/[reportId]-holistic-report.pdf

interface PDFStorageConfig {
  storageType: 'local' | 's3' | 'gcs';
  basePath: string;
  maxFileSize: number;
  retentionDays: number;
  securitySettings: {
    preventEditing: boolean;
    allowPrinting: boolean;
    requirePassword: boolean;
  };
}
```

## Clarifying Questions

### Report Content & Structure
1. **Which workshop responses should be included in the report?** (All reflection answers, assessment scores, specific step responses?)
2. **Should reports be regenerable if users update their responses?** (Before answers are locked)
3. **What level of detail should be included from user reflections?** (Full quotes, summaries, key insights?)

### Workshop Integration
4. **What constitutes "workshop completion" for report generation?** (All steps completed, specific steps, assessment scores submitted?)
5. **Should step 5-2 be immediately accessible or have a delay for report processing?**
6. **How should we handle users who haven't completed required assessments?**

### Visual Design & Branding
7. **Should the report match the exact design provided or can we make minor improvements?**
8. **Are there specific brand guidelines for report design beyond the standard AST colors?**
9. **Should reports include the HeliotropeImaginal logo or just AllStarTeams branding?**

### Data & Privacy
10. **Should report data be stored permanently or generated on-demand?**
11. **What privacy considerations apply to storing report content?**
12. **Should there be different report versions (individual vs. shareable)?**

### Performance & Scalability
13. **What are the expected performance requirements for report generation?**
14. **Should report generation be synchronous or asynchronous?**
15. **How should we handle multiple users completing workshops simultaneously?**
