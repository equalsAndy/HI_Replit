# KAN - Context-Aware Reflection Chat Popup Interface

**Issue Type:** Story  
**Project:** KAN  
**Priority:** High  
**Reporter:** Claude Code  
**Date Created:** 2025-07-28  

## Summary
Replace the current modal-based Reflection Talia interface with a modern popup chat interface that provides context-aware coaching during workshop steps.

## Description
The current Reflection Talia system uses a modal dialog that interrupts the user's workflow. We need to create a more intuitive, context-aware chat popup that appears as an overlay while preserving the user's current workshop context. This will create a more natural coaching experience that feels integrated with the workshop flow.

## User Story
**As a** workshop participant  
**I want** to interact with Reflection Talia through a chat popup interface  
**So that** I can receive coaching assistance without losing my current workshop context and progress

### Chat States
1. **Minimized**: Small floating icon with notification badge
2. **Expanded**: Full chat interface (300px width, 400px height)
3. **Context Header**: Shows current step and relevant info
4. **Message History**: Scrollable conversation with timestamps
5. **Input Area**: Text input with send button and character limit

### Positioning & Behavior
- **Desktop**: Bottom-right corner, 20px margins
- **Mobile**: Responsive positioning that doesn't block navigation
- **Z-index**: High enough to appear over workshop content
- **Animations**: Smooth slide-in/out transitions (300ms)
- **Persistence**: State maintained across page navigation

## Technical Architecture

### Component Structure
```typescript
interface ReflectionChatPopupProps {
  currentStep: string;
  userContext: WorkshopContext;
  isVisible: boolean;
  onToggle: () => void;
}

interface ChatMessage {
  id: string;
  sender: 'user' | 'talia';
  content: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  stepContext?: string;
}

interface ChatSession {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  workshopType: 'ast' | 'ia';
  currentStep: string;
  messages: ChatMessage[];
  startTime: Date;
  lastActivity: Date;
}
```

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// New chat-specific endpoints
GET /api/ai/chat/session/:userId/:workshopType - Get or create chat session
POST /api/ai/chat/message - Send message and get Talia response  
GET /api/ai/chat/history/:sessionId - Retrieve message history
PUT /api/ai/chat/context - Update current step context
DELETE /api/ai/chat/session/:sessionId - Clear chat session
```
