# EPIC: Auth0 Integration with Hybrid Authentication System

**Project:** KAN  
**Issue Type:** Epic  
**Priority:** High  
**Reporter:** Brad Topliff  
**Epic Name:** Auth0 Integration - Hybrid Authentication with Gradual Migration + Invitation Support  

## Epic Summary
Integrate Auth0 authentication into HI_Replit platform using a hybrid approach that preserves existing session-based authentication while enabling gradual user migration to Auth0. This maintains all current functionality (facilitator/cohort management, workshop locking, user roles, invitation system) while adding enterprise-grade security features and social login capabilities.

## Business Value
- **Enhanced Security**: Enterprise-grade authentication with MFA, anomaly detection, and compliance certifications
- **Improved User Experience**: Social logins (Google, Microsoft, etc.), passwordless authentication, and streamlined registration
- **Invitation System Enhancement**: Support for Auth0 social login through invitation codes
- **Reduced Maintenance**: Offload authentication infrastructure to Auth0's managed service
- **Enterprise Appeal**: SSO capabilities for larger organizational customers
- **Future-Ready**: Foundation for advanced authentication features

## ðŸ”’ **Backward Compatibility Guarantee**
**CRITICAL**: 100% of existing authentication functionality remains unchanged:
- All current users continue using existing login forms exactly as before
- All session management (`req.session.userId`) patterns preserved
- All existing API endpoints work identically
- All facilitator console and admin functionality unchanged
- All invitation flows for legacy users continue working
- Zero disruption to current user workflows

## Strategic Alignment
- Supports enterprise customer acquisition with modern authentication standards
- Reduces technical debt by leveraging proven authentication infrastructure
- Maintains existing customer experience during transition
- Enables advanced security features without disrupting current workflows
- Enhances invitation system with social login options

## Success Criteria
- [ ] **Zero functionality loss**: All existing features work identically for legacy users
- [ ] **Seamless coexistence**: Legacy and Auth0 authentication work simultaneously
- [ ] **Enhanced invitations**: Invite codes work with Auth0 social login
- [ ] **Smooth migration**: Users can migrate without losing data, cohort assignments, or progress
- [ ] **Role preservation**: Invitation-based role assignment works with Auth0 users
- [ ] **Cohort continuity**: Facilitator invite codes properly assign Auth0 users to cohorts
- [ ] **Rollback capability**: Complete rollback possible if issues arise

## Technical Approach
**Hybrid Integration Strategy:**
- Auth0 handles authentication verification only
- Existing session management and user context preserved
- Database schema extended to support both auth providers
- Gradual migration with feature flags and optional user opt-in
- Invitation system enhanced to support Auth0 social login flows

## Enhanced Invitation + Auth0 Integration
**Core Requirements:**
- Invitation codes preserve context through Auth0 OAuth flows
- Social login (Google, Microsoft) works seamlessly with facilitator invites
- Role and cohort assignment from invites applies to Auth0 users
- Invite validation and expiration handled correctly for Auth0 flows
- Multiple signup paths: social login OR legacy email signup from invites

## Dependencies
- Existing user management system
- Workshop completion and locking functionality
- Facilitator console and cohort management
- Session-based permission middleware
- Current invitation code system and role assignment logic

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Breaking existing authentication flows
  - **Mitigation**: Hybrid approach maintains legacy system as primary, Auth0 as addition
- **Risk**: Data loss during user migration
  - **Mitigation**: Migration preserves all user data, workshop progress, and cohort assignments
- **Risk**: Invitation system disruption
  - **Mitigation**: Enhanced invitation flow supports both legacy and Auth0 registration
- **Risk**: Complex testing scenarios
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test matrix covering legacy, Auth0, and invitation scenarios

## Timeline
**Estimated Duration:** 7-9 weeks
- Phase 1-2: Foundation and Configuration (2 weeks)
- Phase 3-4: Core Integration and Migration API (2.5 weeks)
- Phase 5-6: Frontend, Invitations, and Migration Strategy (2.5 weeks)
- Phase 7: Comprehensive Testing and Rollout (2 weeks)

## Child Stories
1. Database Schema Updates for Auth0 Integration
2. Auth0 Application Configuration and Environment Setup
3. Hybrid Authentication Middleware Implementation
4. User Migration API and Database Linking
5. Frontend Auth Hook, Migration UI, and Enhanced Invitation Flow
6. Gradual Migration Strategy Implementation
7. Comprehensive Testing and Validation Suite (including invitation scenarios)

**Labels:** auth0, authentication, security, migration, hybrid-integration, invitations, social-login  
**Components:** Backend, Frontend, Database, Security, User Management  
**Fix Version:** TBD

## ðŸŽ¯ **Zero-Risk Implementation Approach**
This implementation adds Auth0 capabilities without changing ANY existing functionality. Current users will not notice any difference in their login experience, while new features become available for those who choose to use them.
