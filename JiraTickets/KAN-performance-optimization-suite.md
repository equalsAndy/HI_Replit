# KAN - Performance Optimization Suite

**Issue Type:** Story  
**Project:** KAN  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Reporter:** Claude Code  
**Date Created:** 2025-01-27

## Summary
Implement comprehensive performance optimizations for the dual-workshop platform to improve user experience and reduce resource usage.

## Description
The current application could benefit from modern performance optimization techniques to handle the complex workshop flows and media-rich content more efficiently.

**Current Performance Challenges:**
- Large bundle sizes with all workshop content loaded upfront
- No component lazy loading for workshop sections
- React Query caching could be optimized
- No service worker for offline capabilities
- Video content loading without optimization

**Business Impact:**
- Slower initial page loads
- Higher bandwidth usage
- Poor experience on slower connections
- Increased infrastructure costs

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Bundle Analysis and Optimization
- [ ] Set up webpack-bundle-analyzer or similar tool
- [ ] Analyze current bundle size and identify large dependencies
- [ ] Implement code splitting for workshop modules
- [ ] Split AST and IA workshop bundles separately
- [ ] Optimize vendor bundle splitting

### Phase 2: React Component Optimization
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for workshop components
- [ ] Add React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Optimize StarCard component rendering
- [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for long lists (if applicable)
- [ ] Add loading states for heavy components

### Phase 3: React Query Optimization
- [ ] Review and optimize cache configuration
- [ ] Implement background refetching strategies
- [ ] Add stale-while-revalidate patterns
- [ ] Optimize query keys for better caching
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates where appropriate

### Phase 4: Asset and Media Optimization
- [ ] Implement image lazy loading
- [ ] Add WebP format support with fallbacks
- [ ] Optimize video loading strategies
- [ ] Implement progressive image loading
- [ ] Add compression for static assets

### Phase 5: Service Worker Implementation
- [ ] Set up service worker for core app caching
- [ ] Cache critical app shell resources
- [ ] Implement offline fallback pages
- [ ] Add background sync for workshop data
- [ ] Cache workshop assets for offline access

## Technical Implementation

### Code Splitting Strategy:
```typescript
// Lazy load workshop components
const AllStarTeamsWorkshop = lazy(() => import('./workshops/AllStarTeamsWorkshop'));
const ImaginalAgilityWorkshop = lazy(() => import('./workshops/ImaginalAgilityWorkshop'));

// Route-based splitting
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/allstarteams/*',
    component: lazy(() => import('./pages/allstarteams'))
  },
  {
    path: '/imaginal-agility/*', 
    component: lazy(() => import('./pages/imaginal-agility'))
  }
];
```

### React Query Optimization:
```typescript
// Optimized query configuration
const queryClient = new QueryClient({
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
      cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
      retry: (failureCount, error) => {
        if (error.status === 404) return false;
        return failureCount < 3;
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Performance Monitoring:
```typescript
// Add performance monitoring
const performanceObserver = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    if (entry.entryType === 'largest-contentful-paint') {
      console.log('LCP:', entry.startTime);
    }
  }
});
performanceObserver.observe({ entryTypes: ['largest-contentful-paint'] });
```

## Performance Targets

### Loading Performance:
- First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 2 seconds
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 3 seconds
- Time to Interactive (TTI) < 4 seconds
- Bundle size reduction of 30%

### Runtime Performance:
- React component re-renders reduced by 50%
- Memory usage stable during workshop navigation
- Smooth 60fps animations
- Video loading optimized for different connection speeds

### Caching Efficiency:
- 90% cache hit rate for workshop data
- Offline functionality for core app features
- Background sync for user progress data

## Files to Optimize

### High-Priority Components:
```
client/src/components/starcard/StarCard.tsx - Heavy rendering
client/src/components/assessment/*.tsx - Complex forms
client/src/pages/allstarteams.tsx - Large workshop page
client/src/pages/imaginal-agility.tsx - Media-heavy content
client/src/hooks/use-navigation-progress.ts - Frequent updates
```

### Bundle Analysis Focus:
- Workshop content modules
- Assessment components
- Video player components
- Chart/visualization libraries

## Monitoring and Measurement

### Performance Metrics:
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- Bundle size monitoring in CI/CD
- Runtime performance profiling
- Memory leak detection

### Tools to Implement:
- Lighthouse CI integration
- Bundle analyzer in build process
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- Real user monitoring (RUM)

## Dependencies
- Webpack bundle analyzer
- React lazy loading utilities
- Service worker libraries (Workbox)
- Performance monitoring tools
- Image optimization libraries

## Risk Assessment
**Medium Priority** - Performance improvements are important for user experience but won't break existing functionality. Incremental implementation allows for testing and rollback if needed.
