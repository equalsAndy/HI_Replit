# KAN - Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure Implementation

**Issue Type:** Epic  
**Project:** KAN (Development tasks)  
**Priority:** High  
**Reporter:** Claude Code  
**Date Created:** 2025-01-27  

## Summary
Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure for dual-workshop platform

## Description
The codebase currently lacks proper testing infrastructure, making it difficult to ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and maintain confidence in deployments. This epic covers implementing a complete testing suite for both AST and IA workshops.

## Current State
- No custom test files found (only node_modules tests)
- Manual testing only for workshop flows
- No automated regression testing
- Deployment confidence relies on manual verification
- Risk of breaking existing functionality with new features

## Expected Outcome
- Robust testing infrastructure with multiple test types
- Automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline
- High confidence in deployments
- Prevention of workshop cross-contamination bugs
- Faster development cycles with automated feedback

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Unit Testing**
   - Jest/Vitest setup with React Testing Library
   - Unit tests for critical business logic (workshop progression, data validation)
   - Component testing for key UI elements
   - Minimum 60% code coverage for critical paths

2. **Integration Testing**
   - API endpoint testing for all workshop routes
   - Database integration tests
   - Authentication flow testing
   - Workshop data persistence testing

3. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Complete AST workshop flow testing
   - Complete IA workshop flow testing
   - Admin dashboard functionality testing
   - Cross-browser compatibility testing

4. **Workshop Separation Testing**
   - Automated tests ensuring AST/IA data isolation
   - Cross-workshop contamination prevention tests
   - Role-based access control verification

## Technical Implementation
- **Framework:** Jest + React Testing Library + Playwright/Cypress
- **Coverage:** Minimum 70% for critical business logic
- **CI Integration:** GitHub Actions or similar
- **Test Data:** Fixtures for consistent test scenarios

## Subtasks
1. Set up testing framework and configuration
2. Implement unit tests for workshop progression logic
3. Create component tests for assessment modals
4. Build API integration test suite
5. Develop E2E tests for complete workshop flows
6. Add workshop separation validation tests
7. Configure CI/CD pipeline integration
8. Create test documentation and guidelines

## Files to Test (Priority)
- `client/src/hooks/use-navigation-progress.ts` (critical workshop logic)
- `server/routes/workshop-data-routes.ts` (data persistence)
- `client/src/components/assessment/` (assessment components)
- `server/services/user-management-service.ts` (user management)
- `client/src/components/navigation/` (navigation components)

## Environment
- **Target:** All environments (dev, staging, production)
- **Browsers:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## Dependencies
- Jest/Vitest testing framework
- React Testing Library
- Playwright or Cypress for E2E
- Test database setup
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
