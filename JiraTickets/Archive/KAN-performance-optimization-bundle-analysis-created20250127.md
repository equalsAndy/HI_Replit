# KAN - Performance Optimization and Bundle Analysis

**Issue Type:** Story  
**Project:** KAN (Development tasks)  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Reporter:** Claude Code  
**Date Created:** 2025-01-27  

## Summary
Implement performance optimizations including bundle analysis, lazy loading, and caching strategies

## Description
The application loads a comprehensive set of dependencies and components, which may impact initial load times and runtime performance. This ticket covers implementing performance optimizations including bundle analysis, code splitting, lazy loading, and improved caching strategies for both workshops.

## Current Performance Concerns
- **Large Bundle Size:** Comprehensive dependency list may create large bundles
- **No Code Splitting:** All components loaded upfront
- **Missing Lazy Loading:** Both workshops load regardless of which is accessed
- **Limited Caching:** React Query present but may need optimization
- **No Performance Monitoring:** Lack of metrics for performance tracking

## Expected Outcome
- Optimized bundle sizes with analysis reporting
- Lazy loading for workshop-specific components
- Improved React Query caching strategies
- Better initial load times and runtime performance
- Performance monitoring and metrics

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Bundle Analysis**
   - Implement webpack-bundle-analyzer or similar
   - Identify largest dependencies and optimization opportunities
   - Set up automated bundle size monitoring in CI/CD
   - Target: Reduce initial bundle size by 20%+

2. **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**
   - Implement route-based code splitting
   - Lazy load AST and IA workshop components separately
   - Lazy load admin dashboard components
   - Progressive loading for assessment components

3. **Caching Optimization**
   - Optimize React Query cache strategies
   - Implement intelligent cache invalidation
   - Add offline-first patterns where appropriate
   - Workshop-specific cache namespacing

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add Core Web Vitals tracking
   - Implement performance metrics collection
   - Monitor bundle size changes over time
   - Track workshop-specific performance metrics

## Technical Implementation
- **Bundle Analysis:** Webpack Bundle Analyzer + CI integration
- **Code Splitting:** React.lazy() with Suspense boundaries
- **Caching:** Enhanced React Query configuration
- **Monitoring:** Web Vitals API + custom metrics

## Key Dependencies to Analyze
```json
{
  "large_dependencies": [
    "@radix-ui/*",
    "recharts", 
    "framer-motion",
    "html2canvas",
    "puppeteer"
  ],
  "workshop_specific": [
    "AST components and data",
    "IA components and data",
    "Assessment systems"
  ]
}
```

## Optimization Strategies
1. **Workshop Separation**
   - Load AST components only when accessing AST workshop
   - Load IA components only when accessing IA workshop
   - Shared components in common chunk

2. **Asset Optimization**
   - Image optimization and lazy loading
   - Font subsetting and preloading
   - CSS purging for unused styles

3. **Runtime Optimization**
   - Component memoization for expensive renders
   - Virtual scrolling for large lists
   - Debounced API calls

## Files to Optimize (Priority)
- `client/src/pages/allstarteams.tsx` (AST workshop entry)
- `client/src/pages/imaginal-agility.tsx` (IA workshop entry)
- `client/src/components/assessment/` (heavy assessment components)
- `client/src/components/content/` (workshop-specific content)
- Admin dashboard components

## Performance Targets
- **Initial Load:** < 3 seconds on 3G connection
- **Time to Interactive:** < 5 seconds
- **Bundle Size:** Main chunk < 500KB gzipped
- **Workshop Load:** < 1 second for workshop switching
- **Lighthouse Score:** > 90 for Performance

## Monitoring Metrics
```javascript
// Key performance indicators
const performanceMetrics = {
  bundleSize: 'Track main/chunk sizes over time',
  loadTime: 'Initial page load performance',
  workshopSwitch: 'Time to switch between workshops', 
  assessmentRender: 'Assessment component render time',
  cacheHitRate: 'React Query cache effectiveness'
};
```

## Environment
- **Development:** Bundle analysis tools and reports
- **Staging:** Performance testing environment
- **Production:** Optimized bundles with monitoring

## Testing Strategy
- Performance regression testing in CI/CD
- Lighthouse CI integration
- Manual testing on various device types
- Network throttling testing

## Implementation Phases
1. **Phase 1:** Bundle analysis and identification
2. **Phase 2:** Route-based code splitting
3. **Phase 3:** Workshop-specific lazy loading
4. **Phase 4:** Caching optimization
5. **Phase 5:** Performance monitoring setup
