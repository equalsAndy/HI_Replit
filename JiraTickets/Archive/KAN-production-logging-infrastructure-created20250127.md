# KAN - Production Logging Infrastructure Implementation

**Issue Type:** Story  
**Project:** KAN (Development tasks)  
**Priority:** High  
**Reporter:** Claude Code  
**Date Created:** 2025-01-27  

## Summary
Replace console logging with professional logging infrastructure for production deployment

## Description
The application currently relies heavily on console.log statements (3,760+ occurrences) for debugging and monitoring. This creates noise in production, lacks proper log levels, and makes troubleshooting difficult. We need to implement a structured logging solution with proper log levels, filtering, and production-ready output.

## Current Issues
- **Excessive Console Output:** 3,760+ console statements across 360 files
- **No Log Levels:** All output treated equally (no debug/info/warn/error distinction)
- **Production Noise:** Debug messages polluting production console
- **No Centralized Logging:** Difficult to aggregate and analyze logs
- **Performance Impact:** Excessive logging may affect application performance

## Expected Outcome
- Professional logging infrastructure with structured output
- Environment-based log level control
- Centralized log aggregation capability
- Improved debugging and monitoring in production
- Clean production console output

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Replace Console Logging**
   - Implement Winston or Pino logging library
   - Replace console.log/warn/error with structured logging
   - Maintain existing debug information in development

2. **Log Level Management**
   - Configure log levels: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
   - Environment-based configuration (production = ERROR/WARN only)
   - Runtime log level adjustment capability

3. **Structured Logging**
   - JSON formatted logs for production
   - Include context information (userId, sessionId, workshop type)
   - Timestamp and correlation ID support

4. **Log Aggregation Ready**
   - Format compatible with log aggregation services
   - Support for correlation IDs across requests
   - Structured metadata for filtering and searching

## Technical Implementation
- **Server-side:** Winston with JSON formatter
- **Client-side:** Custom logging service with console fallback
- **Configuration:** Environment-based log levels
- **Format:** Structured JSON with contextual metadata

## Current High-Volume Logging Areas
```typescript
// Areas with excessive logging (priority for cleanup):
- Navigation progress debugging
- Video player state logging  
- Workshop step validation
- User authentication flows
- Admin dashboard operations
```

## Log Level Guidelines
- **ERROR:** Application errors, failed requests, data corruption
- **WARN:** Deprecated features, configuration issues, recoverable errors
- **INFO:** User actions, workshop completions, system state changes
- **DEBUG:** Detailed debugging information (development only)

## Files Requiring Updates (High Priority)
- `client/src/hooks/use-navigation-progress.ts` (54+ console statements)
- `server/routes/workshop-data-routes.ts` (97+ console statements)
- `client/src/components/layout/NavBar.tsx` (navigation debugging)
- `server/services/user-management-service.ts` (user operations)
- `client/src/components/assessment/` (assessment logging)

## Configuration Example
```javascript
// Environment-based logging configuration
const logConfig = {
  development: { level: 'debug', format: 'simple' },
  staging: { level: 'info', format: 'json' },
  production: { level: 'warn', format: 'json' }
};
```

## Environment
- **Server:** Node.js with Winston/Pino
- **Client:** Custom logging service
- **Production:** Structured JSON logs only
- **Development:** Human-readable format with full debug info

## Performance Considerations
- Asynchronous logging to prevent blocking
- Log message formatting only when necessary
- Configurable log sampling for high-frequency events
- Memory-efficient log rotation

## Migration Strategy
1. Implement logging infrastructure
2. Update high-volume logging areas first
3. Gradual replacement of console statements
4. Maintain development debugging capability
5. Production deployment with clean logs
