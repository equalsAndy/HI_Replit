## Technical Implementation Notes

### âœ… COMPLETED Backend Implementation
- âœ… AI management API routes (`/api/admin/ai/personas`, `/api/admin/ai/reflection-areas`)
- âœ… In-memory persona configuration system with environment filtering
- âœ… Training documents API integration
- âœ… Environment-based filtering for personas and admin tabs

### âœ… COMPLETED Frontend Implementation
- âœ… Comprehensive AI management interface in admin console
- âœ… Persona management component with environment badges
- âœ… Training documents management with document type grouping
- âœ… Save/Cancel functionality for document access changes
- âœ… Environment configuration utility system
- âœ… Fixed undefined array mapping errors in PersonaManagement.tsx (client/src/components/admin/PersonaManagement.tsx:396, 491, 666)

### ðŸ”„ REMAINING Implementation
- [ ] Usage monitoring dashboard with real-time metrics
- [ ] API call tracking and cost monitoring system
- [ ] Rate limiting and throttling controls
- [ ] Global AI toggle system
- [ ] Database schema for persistent AI configuration

### Database Schema Considerations
```sql
-- AI Configuration Table
ai_configuration (
  id, feature_name, enabled, rate_limit, 
  max_tokens, timeout_ms, created_at, updated_at
)

-- AI Usage Tracking Table
ai_usage_logs (
  id, user_id, feature_name, api_call_count, 
  tokens_used, response_time_ms, success, 
  error_message, timestamp
)

-- AI Budget/Alerts Table
ai_budget_alerts (
  id, alert_type, threshold, current_usage, 
  alert_triggered, last_reset, created_at
)
```

## Clarifying Questions

### Scope & Prioritization
1. **Which AI management features should be implemented first?** (Global toggle vs. detailed monitoring vs. throttling)
2. **What level of granularity is needed for usage tracking?** (Per user, per feature, per conversation?)
3. **Should there be different admin permission levels for AI management?** (View-only vs. full control)

### UI/UX Design
4. **What should the descriptive header text say exactly?** ("Here is where you manage..." - complete this)
5. **Should the AI tab be always visible or only when AI features are enabled?**
6. **How should we handle the visual design of the usage dashboard?** (Charts, tables, cards?)

### Technical Implementation
7. **How should we handle data retention for usage logs?** (How long to keep historical data?)
8. **Should AI configuration changes take effect immediately or require restart?**
9. **What level of real-time updates are needed?** (Live dashboard vs. periodic refresh)

### Business Logic
10. **What happens when AI is disabled mid-conversation?** (Graceful degradation strategy)
11. **Should we have different rate limits for different user types?** (Admins, test users, regular users)
12. **How should cost tracking be calculated and displayed?** (Per token, per API call, estimated costs)

### Security & Monitoring
13. **What security controls are needed for AI management access?**
14. **Should there be audit logging for AI configuration changes?**
15. **What alerts/notifications should be sent when thresholds are exceeded?**
