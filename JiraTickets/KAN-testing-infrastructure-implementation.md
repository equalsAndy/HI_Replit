# KAN - Testing Infrastructure Implementation

**Issue Type:** Story  
**Project:** KAN  
**Priority:** High  
**Reporter:** Claude Code  
**Date Created:** 2025-01-27

## Summary
Implement comprehensive testing infrastructure for the dual-workshop platform to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## Description
The codebase currently lacks automated testing infrastructure. With 3,760+ console statements and complex workshop logic across AST and IA systems, we need robust testing to maintain code quality and catch issues early.

**Current State:**
- No custom test files found (only node_modules tests)
- No test configuration or setup
- Manual testing only for critical functionality
- High risk of regressions during development

**Business Impact:**
- Reduced confidence in deployments
- Increased debugging time
- Potential production issues
- Slower development velocity

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- [ ] Install and configure Jest/Vitest testing framework
- [ ] Set up React Testing Library for component tests
- [ ] Configure test environment variables
- [ ] Add test scripts to package.json
- [ ] Create basic test directory structure

### Phase 2: Critical Path Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for authentication logic (`server/routes/auth-routes.ts`)
- [ ] Write unit tests for user management service (`server/services/user-management-service.ts`)
- [ ] Write component tests for StarCard component
- [ ] Write component tests for assessment modals
- [ ] Write API integration tests for workshop data endpoints

### Phase 3: Workshop-Specific Tests
- [ ] Write tests for AST workshop flow logic
- [ ] Write tests for IA workshop flow logic
- [ ] Write tests for workshop separation validation
- [ ] Write tests for navigation progress tracking
- [ ] Write tests for video progress validation

### Phase 4: End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Set up Playwright or Cypress for E2E testing
- [ ] Write E2E tests for complete workshop flows
- [ ] Write E2E tests for admin functionality
- [ ] Write E2E tests for user registration/login

## Technical Notes

### Files to Focus On:
```
server/routes/auth-routes.ts - Authentication logic
server/services/user-management-service.ts - User operations
client/src/components/starcard/StarCard.tsx - Core component
client/src/components/assessment/*.tsx - Assessment components
server/routes/workshop-data-routes.ts - Workshop APIs
```

### Test Configuration Requirements:
- Separate test database configuration
- Mock external services (Claude API, etc.)
- Test data fixtures for workshops
- Environment-specific test settings

### Workshop Separation Testing:
- Ensure AST tests don't affect IA data
- Validate cross-workshop contamination prevention
- Test role-based access controls

## Performance Targets
- All tests should run in under 30 seconds
- Coverage target: 70% for critical paths
- CI/CD integration ready

## Dependencies
- Install testing dependencies: Jest/Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright
- Set up test database environment
- Configure CI/CD pipeline integration

## Risk Assessment
**High Priority** - Without proper testing, the complex dual-workshop system is at risk of:
- Data contamination between workshops
- Authentication/authorization bugs
- Breaking changes during feature development
- Production incidents
