# KAN - Security System Enhancement and Audit

**Issue Type:** Epic  
**Project:** KAN  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Reporter:** Claude Code  
**Date Created:** 2025-07-27  

## Summary
Comprehensive security audit and enhancement of the current authentication and authorization system to improve security posture, implement missing security features, and establish security best practices.

## Current Security System Analysis

### Authentication System
**Current Implementation:**
- Session-based authentication using Express sessions
- Password hashing with bcrypt (10 salt rounds for new users, mixed implementations)
- Username/email login support
- Invite-based registration system with 12-character alphanumeric codes

**Password Policies:**
- **Invite Registration**: 8+ characters, requires uppercase, lowercase, and number
- **Admin User Creation**: 6+ characters minimum
- **User Profile Changes**: 6+ characters minimum
- Users can change passwords with current password verification

**Session Management:**
- Express session middleware with session storage
- No explicit session timeout configuration
- Sessions persist until browser closure or explicit logout

### Authorization System
**Role-Based Access Control:**
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management, workshop data access
- **Facilitator**: Limited user management, assigned user data access
- **Participant**: Workshop participation, own data access only
- **Student**: Basic workshop access

**Workshop Access Control:**
- Feature flags for workshop availability (AST/IA)
- Content access levels: 'student', 'professional', 'both'
- Environment-based feature gating (development vs production)

**Data Access Patterns:**
- User-scoped data access through middleware
- Workshop data isolation between AST and IA
- Facilitator-scoped user management
- Admin bypass for all data access

### Current Security Gaps

**Authentication Weaknesses:**
1. **Inconsistent Password Policies**: Different requirements across contexts
2. **No Password Expiration**: Passwords never expire
3. **No Account Lockout**: No protection against brute force attacks
4. **No Two-Factor Authentication**: Single factor authentication only
5. **Session Security**: No explicit session timeout or security headers

**Authorization Issues:**
1. **Role Escalation Risk**: No audit trail for role changes
2. **Data Export Controls**: Minimal restrictions on data export
3. **API Rate Limiting**: No rate limiting on authentication endpoints
4. **Cross-Workshop Data Leakage**: Potential for data access across workshops

**Infrastructure Security:**
1. **No Security Headers**: Missing CSRF, XSS, and other security headers
2. **No Request Logging**: Limited audit trail for security events
3. **Environment Separation**: Development features accessible in production
4. **Database Access**: Direct database access without additional authentication layers

**Monitoring and Compliance:**
1. **No Security Monitoring**: No failed login attempt tracking
2. **No Audit Logging**: Limited audit trail for sensitive operations
3. **No Data Retention Policies**: Indefinite data storage
4. **No GDPR Compliance Features**: No data deletion or export automation

## Proposed Security Enhancements

### Phase 1: Authentication Hardening (High Priority)
- [ ] Implement unified password policy (12+ characters, complexity requirements)
- [ ] Add account lockout after failed attempts (5 attempts, 15-minute lockout)
- [ ] Implement session timeout (2-hour idle, 8-hour absolute)
- [ ] Add password expiration policy (90 days for admins, 180 days for users)
- [ ] Implement password history (prevent reuse of last 5 passwords)

### Phase 2: Authorization Enhancement (High Priority)
- [ ] Add role change audit logging
- [ ] Implement data access audit trails
- [ ] Add API rate limiting (10 requests/minute for auth endpoints)
- [ ] Enhance workshop data isolation validation
- [ ] Add permission-based access control (move beyond simple roles)

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Security (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Implement security headers (CSRF, XSS protection, HSTS)
- [ ] Add request logging with IP tracking
- [ ] Implement environment-specific feature flags
- [ ] Add database connection encryption
- [ ] Implement API key authentication for service-to-service calls

### Phase 4: Monitoring and Compliance (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Add security event monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement comprehensive audit logging
- [ ] Add GDPR compliance features (data export, deletion)
- [ ] Implement data retention policies
- [ ] Add security dashboard for administrators

### Phase 5: Advanced Security (Low Priority)
- [ ] Two-factor authentication (TOTP)
- [ ] Single Sign-On (SSO) integration
- [ ] Advanced threat detection
- [ ] Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- [ ] Security penetration testing integration

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Authentication Improvements
```typescript
// Enhanced password policy
const securePasswordSchema = z.string()
  .min(12, 'Password must be at least 12 characters')
  .regex(/[A-Z]/, 'Must contain uppercase letter')
  .regex(/[a-z]/, 'Must contain lowercase letter')
  .regex(/\d/, 'Must contain number')
  .regex(/[^A-Za-z0-9]/, 'Must contain special character');

// Account lockout implementation
interface AccountLockout {
  userId: number;
  failedAttempts: number;
  lockedUntil: Date | null;
  lastAttempt: Date;
}
```

### Session Security
```typescript
// Enhanced session configuration
app.use(session({
  secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,
  resave: false,
  saveUninitialized: false,
  cookie: {
    secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
    httpOnly: true,
    maxAge: 2 * 60 * 60 * 1000, // 2 hours
    sameSite: 'strict'
  },
  rolling: true // Reset timeout on activity
}));
```

### Audit Logging
```typescript
interface SecurityEvent {
  id: string;
  userId: number | null;
  eventType: 'login' | 'logout' | 'password_change' | 'role_change' | 'data_access';
  ipAddress: string;
  userAgent: string;
  success: boolean;
  details: Record<string, any>;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```
