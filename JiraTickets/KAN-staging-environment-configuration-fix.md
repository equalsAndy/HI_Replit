# KAN - Fix Staging Environment Configuration Issues

**Issue Type:** Bug  
**Project:** KAN  
**Priority:** High  
**Reporter:** Claude Code  
**Date Created:** 2025-07-31

## Summary
Fix hardcoded environment detection and npm start script issues that prevented staging environment from displaying personas and connecting to Claude API.

## Description
The staging environment experienced critical configuration issues that prevented AI functionality and persona management visibility. Two root causes were identified:

1. **Hardcoded npm start script**: `NODE_ENV=production` was hardcoded in package.json, overriding runtime environment variables
2. **Inconsistent environment detection**: Different parts of the application used different environment variable checks

This caused personas to be filtered out in staging (showing 0/2 available) and Claude API to be disabled, resulting in fallback responses.

## Root Causes
- `package.json` start script: `"start": "NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js"`
- Persona filtering using `NODE_ENV` while Claude API used `ENVIRONMENT` variable
- Default persona environments excluded `production`

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Remove hardcoded NODE_ENV from npm start script
2. ✅ Standardize environment detection across application
3. ✅ Update default persona environments to include all environments
4. ✅ Add environment validation logging to startup
5. ✅ Update deployment documentation
6. ✅ Create comprehensive issue documentation

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. **package.json**
   - Changed `"start": "NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js"` to `"start": "node dist/index.js"`
   - Added environment-specific start scripts

2. **server/routes/persona-management-routes.ts**
   - Line 415: Updated environment detection to `process.env.ENVIRONMENT || process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'`
   - Line 142: Updated Reflection Talia fallback environments to include `'production'`

3. **server/index.ts**
   - Added environment configuration logging to validateEnvironment()

4. **CLAUDE.md**
   - Updated staging deployment commands
   - Documented proper environment variable setup

### Database Updates Applied:
```sql
-- Updated both personas to include production environment
UPDATE talia_personas 
SET environments = array['development', 'staging', 'production']
WHERE id IN ('ast_reflection', 'star_report');
```

## Test Plan
- [ ] Deploy to staging with fixed configuration
- [ ] Verify both personas visible in admin interface (2/2)
- [ ] Test Claude API connectivity (no fallback messages)
- [ ] Verify environment logging shows correct values
- [ ] Test Report Talia report generation
- [ ] Test Reflection Talia chat responses

## Impact Assessment
**Before Fix:**
- Staging AI features: Non-functional
- Persona management: Empty (0/2 personas)
- User experience: Degraded (fallback messages only)

**After Fix:**
- Staging AI features: Fully functional
- Persona management: Both personas visible (2/2)
- User experience: Equivalent to development environment

## Documentation
- Created `/docs/staging-environment-fix-2025-07-31.md` with complete issue analysis
- Updated CLAUDE.md with correct deployment procedures
- Added environment validation logging for future debugging

## Prevention Measures
1. Pre-deployment environment variable verification
2. Standardized environment detection patterns
3. Default persona environments include all environments
4. Enhanced startup logging for environment debugging

## Related Issues
- Environment inconsistency between development and staging
- Claude API configuration dependencies
- Persona visibility filtering logic
