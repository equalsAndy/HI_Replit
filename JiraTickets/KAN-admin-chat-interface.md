# KAN-Admin Chat Interface with Cross-Project Awareness
**Issue Type:** Story
**Project:** KAN
**Priority:** High
**Reporter:** Claude Code
**Date Created:** 2025-08-02

## Summary
Build comprehensive admin chat interface with OpenAI GPT-4, model selection, cross-project awareness, and persona training capabilities.

## Description
Create an advanced admin chat interface that allows administrators to interact with OpenAI models, train personas, test different approaches, and access information from all projects for comprehensive system analysis and improvement.

## Business Value
- **Real-time Persona Training**: Immediate feedback and improvement
- **System Analysis**: Cross-project insights for better decision making
- **A/B Testing**: Compare model performance in real-time
- **Cost Optimization**: Test before deploying expensive models
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Document successful conversation patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Chat interface in admin dashboard
2. ✅ Model selection dropdown (GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo)
3. ✅ Cross-project resource awareness and reporting
4. ✅ Conversation history management
5. ✅ Document upload for real-time training
6. ✅ Persona switching (Report Talia, Reflection Talia, etc.)
7. ✅ A/B testing interface for model comparison
8. ✅ Cost tracking per conversation
9. ✅ Export conversation for documentation

## Technical Implementation

### API Routes
```typescript
// server/routes/admin-chat-routes.ts
POST   /api/admin/chat/message          // Send message with model selection
GET    /api/admin/chat/history          // Get conversation history
POST   /api/admin/chat/upload           // Upload training document
PUT    /api/admin/chat/persona/:id      // Switch active persona
GET    /api/admin/chat/projects/summary // Get cross-project resources
POST   /api/admin/chat/ab-test          // Run A/B test between models
GET    /api/admin/chat/costs            // Get cost breakdown
POST   /api/admin/chat/export           // Export conversation
```

### Frontend Components
- **ChatInterface**: Main chat component with model selector
- **ModelSelector**: Dropdown for GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo
- **PersonaSelector**: Switch between Talia personas
- **ProjectSummary**: Display cross-project information
- **ConversationHistory**: Manage and search past conversations
- **ABTestPanel**: Compare responses from different models
- **CostMonitor**: Real-time cost tracking

### Cross-Project Awareness Features
- Vector store summaries from all projects
- Document counts and types per project
- Usage statistics across projects
- Cost breakdown by project and model
- Performance metrics comparison

## User Stories

### As an Admin, I want to:
1. **Chat with different models** to test response quality
2. **Switch between personas** to train specific capabilities
3. **See all project resources** to understand system state
4. **Upload documents** for immediate training and testing
5. **Compare model responses** side-by-side for quality assessment
6. **Monitor costs** in real-time during conversations
7. **Export successful patterns** for documentation and replication

### As a System Administrator, I want to:
1. **Monitor cross-project usage** for optimization opportunities
2. **Test new training approaches** before system-wide deployment
3. **Document successful patterns** for team knowledge sharing
4. **Optimize model selection** based on cost/quality analysis

## Technical Specifications

### Model Selection Interface
```typescript
interface ModelConfig {
  name: 'gpt-4o-mini' | 'gpt-4' | 'gpt-4-turbo';
  displayName: string;
  costPerToken: number;
  recommended: string[];
  maxTokens: number;
}
```

### Cross-Project Summary
```typescript
interface ProjectSummary {
  projectName: string;
  vectorStores: VectorStoreSummary[];
  documentCount: number;
  lastActivity: Date;
  monthlyCost: number;
  usage: UsageStats;
}
```

### A/B Testing Framework
```typescript
interface ABTestResult {
  prompt: string;
  modelA: { model: string; response: string; cost: number; time: number };
  modelB: { model: string; response: string; cost: number; time: number };
  quality: QualityMetrics;
  recommendation: string;
}
```
