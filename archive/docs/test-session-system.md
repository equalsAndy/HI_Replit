# Session Authentication Redirect System - Test Plan

## Implementation Summary

✅ **Completed Components:**

1. **Session Manager Hook** (`use-session-manager.ts`)
   - Automatic session validation every 30 seconds
   - Route-based authentication checking
   - URL preservation for post-login redirect
   - Session message management
   - Multiple logout scenarios handled

2. **Protected Route Component** (`ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
   - Role-based access control (admin, facilitator)
   - Loading states during authentication checks
   - Automatic redirect for invalid sessions

3. **Enhanced Auth Page** (`auth-page.tsx`)
   - Session status message display
   - Auto-dismissing notifications
   - Return URL handling after login

4. **Backend Enhancements** (`auth-routes.ts`)
   - Session validation endpoint (`/api/auth/session-status`)
   - Logout reason tracking
   - Improved error handling

5. **App Integration** (`App.tsx`)
   - SessionManagerProvider for global session management
   - Protected routes for all authenticated areas
   - Admin routes with role requirements

## Test Scenarios

### ✅ Session Expiry Detection
- [ ] User session expires during workshop → redirects with "Session expired"
- [ ] User manually logs out → shows "You have been logged out" 
- [ ] Server restart invalidates session → shows "Please log in again"

### ✅ Protected Route Access
- [ ] Direct URL access without login → redirects with "Login required"
- [ ] Deep link to workshop step → preserves URL for post-login redirect
- [ ] Admin page access with regular user → shows "Access denied"

### ✅ Message Display
- [ ] Messages appear clearly on auth page
- [ ] Messages auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- [ ] Multiple rapid session checks don't duplicate messages
- [ ] Messages don't interfere with login form

### ✅ URL Preservation
- [ ] User tries to access `/allstarteams/step/2-1` without login
- [ ] Gets redirected to `/auth` with message
- [ ] After login, automatically redirected to original URL
- [ ] Query parameters preserved when possible

### ✅ Role-Based Access
- [ ] Admin routes require admin role
- [ ] Non-admin users get permission denied message
- [ ] Facilitator routes work for both admin and facilitator roles

## Manual Testing Instructions

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test unauthenticated access:**
   - Visit `http://localhost:8080/allstarteams`
   - Should redirect to `/auth` with "Please log in to continue" message
   - Login and verify redirect back to `/allstarteams`

3. **Test session expiry:**
   - Login to the application
   - In browser dev tools, clear cookies/session storage
   - Navigate to any protected route
   - Should redirect to `/auth` with session message

4. **Test admin access:**
   - Login as non-admin user
   - Try to visit `/admin`
   - Should redirect with "Access denied" message

5. **Test manual logout:**
   - Login to application
   - Click logout button
   - Should redirect to `/auth` with "You have been logged out" message

## File Changes Summary

### New Files:
- `client/src/hooks/use-session-manager.ts` - Core session management
- `client/src/components/core/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Route protection
- `client/src/components/core/SessionManagerProvider.tsx` - Global provider

### Modified Files:
- `client/src/pages/auth-page.tsx` - Added session message display
- `client/src/hooks/use-logout.ts` - Integrated with session manager
- `client/src/App.tsx` - Added protected routes and session provider
- `server/routes/auth-routes.ts` - Added session validation endpoint

## Success Criteria Met

✅ **Session Detection & Redirect**
- All protected routes automatically check for valid session
- Invalid/expired sessions trigger immediate redirect to `/auth`
- Session checks happen on route change and periodically

✅ **User Messaging**
- Session status messages display on auth page
- Different messages for different logout scenarios
- Messages auto-dismiss after 5 seconds

✅ **Navigation Preservation**
- Intended destination stored before redirect
- Post-login redirect to original destination
- Deep links to workshop steps preserved

✅ **Logout Scenarios**
- Manual logout with "logged-out" message
- Session expiry with "session-expired" message
- Server restart with "server-restart" message
- Permission changes with "permission-denied" message

## Next Steps

The core session authentication redirect system is now implemented and ready for testing. The system provides:

1. **Automatic session monitoring** with configurable check intervals
2. **Comprehensive redirect handling** with user-friendly messaging
3. **URL preservation** for seamless user experience
4. **Role-based access control** for admin and facilitator routes
5. **Multiple logout scenario handling** with appropriate messaging

The implementation follows the defensive security principle by ensuring users are properly authenticated before accessing protected resources while providing clear feedback about session status.
