# REPLIT AGENT: Implement Facilitator Invite Management with Role-Based Scoping
Modify the invite system to support facilitator access with proper role-based filtering:
TASK: Enable facilitators to create/manage invites while maintaining admin oversight
Backend Changes Needed:

Update admin routes for invite management:

typescript// In server/routes/admin-routes.ts

// Modify GET /invites route to be role-aware
router.get('/invites', requireAuth, isFacilitatorOrAdmin, async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const userRole = (req.session as any).userRole;
  const userId = (req.session as any).userId;
  
  let invitesResult;
  if (userRole === 'facilitator') {
    // Facilitators only see invites they created
    invitesResult = await inviteService.getInvitesByCreator(userId);
  } else {
    // Admins see all invites
    invitesResult = await inviteService.getAllInvites();
  }
  
  // Add creator name to invites for admin view
  if (userRole === 'admin') {
    // Join with users table to get creator names
  }
});

// Modify POST /invites route to support facilitators
router.post('/invites', requireAuth, isFacilitatorOrAdmin, async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  const userRole = (req.session as any).userRole;
  
  // Restrict facilitators to participant/student roles only
  if (userRole === 'facilitator') {
    const allowedRoles = ['participant', 'student'];
    if (!allowedRoles.includes(req.body.role)) {
      return res.status(403).json({ 
        message: 'Facilitators can only create participant and student invites' 
      });
    }
  }
  
  // Create invite with proper createdBy tracking
});

Update user registration to track invite creator:

typescript// When user registers with invite, store who created the invite
// This goes in the users table as a reference to the facilitator

Add creator information to user management:

typescript// Modify getAllUsers to include invite creator information
// Add columns: "Created By" and "Invite Used"
Frontend Changes Needed:

Update InviteManagement component to be role-aware
Restrict role options for facilitators (only participant/student)
Add creator column to admin user management table
Filter invite lists based on user role

Database Schema Updates:
sql-- Add invited_by field to users table to track who invited them
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN invited_by INTEGER REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;
Key Features:

✅ Facilitators can create participant/student invites only
✅ Facilitators see only their own invites
✅ Admins see all invites with creator information
✅ User management shows who invited each user
✅ Proper role restrictions enforced
