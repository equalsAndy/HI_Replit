# Replit Prompt: Replace Existing Imagination Assessment Component

## Project Overview
Update the existing imagination assessment in the Heliotrope Imaginal Workshops app by replacing it with the HI Imagination Assessment V3. This is NOT a new learning path - simply replacing the current imagination assessment component with the new 5-capacity assessment while maintaining all existing app structure, navigation, and styling.

## Scope: Component Replacement Only
- **Replace:** Existing imagination assessment content/questions
- **Keep:** All existing navigation, styling, database structure, UI patterns
- **Maintain:** Current user flow and assessment placement in the app
- **Update:** Only the assessment questions, scoring, and results visualization

## Core Requirements

### 1. Assessment Structure (Replace Existing Questions)
Update the existing imagination assessment to measure these five capacities:

**IMAGINATION** (13 questions total across 7 sub-dimensions):
- Generative Fluency (2 questions): "I can easily come up with multiple, unconventional ideas." + "I often generate new ideas in my daily life."
- Temporal Flexibility (2 questions): "I can vividly imagine different possible futures or pasts." + "I often reflect on alternative outcomes before making decisions."
- Perspectival Agility (2 questions): "I can imagine experiences beyond my current reality." + "I frequently consider other people's viewpoints in discussions."
- Boundary Permeability (2 questions): "I'm comfortable blending ideas from different domains (e.g., science and art)." + "I actively seek inspiration from outside my usual field."
- Ambiguity Tolerance (2 questions): "I can explore complex ideas without needing quick answers." + "I feel comfortable with uncertainty when solving problems."
- Embodied Translation (2 questions): "I can turn abstract ideas into tangible actions or prototypes." + "I take steps to bring my ideas to life."
- Playful Wonder (1 question): "I allow myself to daydream, imagine, or wonderâ€”even if it feels unproductive."

**CURIOSITY** (2 questions):
- "I frequently seek out new experiences or knowledge."
- "I enjoy exploring unfamiliar topics."

**EMPATHY** (2 questions):
- "I'm good at understanding how others feel."
- "I try to see situations through others' eyes."

**CREATIVITY** (2 questions):
- "I engage regularly in creative activities (e.g., art, writing, design)."
- "I often come up with novel solutions to everyday challenges."

**COURAGE** (2 questions):
- "I take risks to pursue ideas or values I believe in."
- "I stand up for what I believe, even when it's unpopular."

### 2. Implementation Approach

**What to Update:**
- Replace current imagination assessment questions with the 15 questions above
- Update scoring to calculate 5 main capacity scores (Imagination, Curiosity, Empathy, Creativity, Courage)
- Replace current results visualization with 5-axis radar chart
- Update any assessment intro text to mention the 5 capacities

**What to Keep:**
- Existing 5-point Likert scale (1=Strongly Disagree to 5=Strongly Agree)
- Current UI components and styling
- Existing navigation flow and progress tracking
- Current database storage approach
- Existing assessment placement in the app flow
- All existing responsive design and mobile patterns

### 3. Scoring Updates

**Replace Current Scoring With:**
```javascript
// Calculate sub-dimension averages for Imagination (13 questions total)
const generativeFluencyScore = (generativeFluency1 + generativeFluency2) / 2;
const temporalFlexibilityScore = (temporalFlexibility1 + temporalFlexibility2) / 2;
const perspectivalAgilityScore = (perspectivalAgility1 + perspectivalAgility2) / 2;
const boundaryPermeabilityScore = (boundaryPermeability1 + boundaryPermeability2) / 2;
const ambiguityToleranceScore = (ambiguityTolerance1 + ambiguityTolerance2) / 2;
const embodiedTranslationScore = (embodiedTranslation1 + embodiedTranslation2) / 2;
const playfulWonderScore = playfulWonder; // single question

// Overall Imagination score (average of 7 sub-dimensions)
const imaginationScore = (
  generativeFluencyScore +
  temporalFlexibilityScore +
  perspectivalAgilityScore +
  boundaryPermeabilityScore +
  ambiguityToleranceScore +
  embodiedTranslationScore +
  playfulWonderScore
) / 7;

// Calculate other capacity averages
const curiosityScore = (curiosity1 + curiosity2) / 2;
const empathyScore = (empathy1 + empathy2) / 2;
const creativityScore = (creativity1 + creativity2) / 2;
const courageScore = (courage1 + courage2) / 2;
```

### 4. Results Visualization Update

**Replace Current Chart With:**
- 5-axis radar chart showing: Imagination, Curiosity, Empathy, Creativity, Courage
- Use existing chart library (recharts) and styling patterns
- Keep existing results page layout and UI components
- Maintain existing color scheme and responsive design

### 5. Database Storage Update

**Update Assessment Data Structure:**
```javascript
// Store in existing userAssessments table with updated structure
{
  assessmentType: 'imaginationAssessment', // keep existing
  data: {
    // Replace current data structure with:
    responses: {
      imagination: [q1, q2, q3, q4, q5, q6, q7, q8, q9, q10, q11, q12, q13], // 13 questions
      curiosity: [q14, q15], // 2 questions  
      empathy: [q16, q17], // 2 questions
      creativity: [q18, q19], // 2 questions
      courage: [q20, q21] // 2 questions
    },
    scores: {
      imagination: {
        overall: calculatedOverallScore,
        subDimensions: {
          generativeFluency: calculatedScore,
          temporalFlexibility: calculatedScore,
          perspectivalAgility: calculatedScore,
          boundaryPermeability: calculatedScore,
          ambiguityTolerance: calculatedScore,
          embodiedTranslation: calculatedScore,
          playfulWonder: calculatedScore
        }
      },
      curiosity: calculatedScore,
      empathy: calculatedScore,
      creativity: calculatedScore,
      courage: calculatedScore
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Files to Update (Existing Components Only)

**Primary Files to Modify:**
- The existing imagination assessment component (likely `ImaginalAssessmentContent.tsx` or similar)
- The existing results/visualization component for imagination assessment
- Any existing scoring/calculation utilities for imagination assessment

**Keep Unchanged:**
- Navigation components and routing
- Database schema and API routes
- Authentication and session management
- Main app structure and other assessments
- UI component library and styling system

### 7. User Experience Requirements

**Maintain Existing UX:**
- Same assessment flow and navigation patterns
- Same progress indicators and step tracking
- Same responsive behavior and mobile design
- Same integration with user profile and dashboard
- Same test user functionality and reset capabilities

**Update Only:**
- Question content and assessment intro text
- Results interpretation and visualization
- Score calculation methodology

### 8. Quality Assurance

**Test That:**
- All 21 questions display correctly with existing styling (13 Imagination + 2 Curiosity + 2 Empathy + 2 Creativity + 2 Courage)
- Scoring calculations work properly for all 5 capacities and 7 imagination sub-dimensions
- Radar chart displays correctly on all screen sizes
- Results save to database in updated format
- Existing navigation and progress tracking still work
- Assessment integrates seamlessly with rest of app flow

## Success Criteria
- Existing imagination assessment is replaced with new 5-capacity assessment
- All app styling, navigation, and functionality remains unchanged
- New assessment feels native to the existing app experience
- Users can complete the updated assessment and view results normally
- No disruption to other app features or assessments

## Implementation Notes
- This is a **component update**, not a new feature
- Maintain all existing code patterns and conventions
- Use existing error handling and user feedback systems
- Keep existing accessibility features and responsive design
- Preserve existing admin functionality and user management
