# REPLIT AGENT: Test User System Discovery & Current State Analysis

## üéØ OBJECTIVE
Examine the current test user implementation in the Heliotrope Imaginal project to understand what exists and what needs enhancement, based on the comprehensive analysis files already created.

## üìã DISCOVERY TASKS

### **1. Verify Analysis Files Exist**
Check if these analysis files were created and review their contents:
- `docs/test-user-analysis.md`
- `docs/test-user-components-inventory.md` 
- `docs/test-user-security-audit.md`
- `docs/test-user-code-examples.md`

### **2. Examine Current Test User Implementation**
Review the key files identified in the analysis:

**Core Test User Files:**
- `client/src/components/test-users/TestUserBanner.tsx`
- `client/src/components/test-users/TestUserPicker.tsx`
- `client/src/components/admin/UserManagement.tsx`
- `client/src/components/admin/UserUploader.tsx`
- `server/services/user-management-service.ts`

**Authentication & Security:**
- `server/auth-routes.ts`
- `shared/schema.ts` (users table with isTestUser field)
- Any existing test user middleware or security patterns

### **3. Assessment Component Analysis**
Examine the assessment components that lack test features:

**AST Assessment Components:**
- `client/src/components/assessment/AssessmentModal.tsx`
- `client/src/components/flow/FlowAssessment.tsx`
- `client/src/components/flow/FlowAssessmentSimple.tsx`
- `client/src/components/content/CantrilLadderView.tsx`

**IA Assessment Components:**
- `client/src/components/assessment/ImaginalAgilityAssessment.tsx`
- `client/src/components/assessment/ImaginalAgilityAssessmentModal.tsx`

### **4. Security Pattern Review**
Check current security implementations and identify gaps:

**Look for:**
- How `isTestUser` is currently validated
- Whether server-side protection exists for test endpoints
- Client-side security patterns used
- Any username pattern matching (security risk)

### **5. Current Test Data Patterns**
Examine existing test data generation:

**Review:**
- How test data is currently generated in `UserUploader.tsx`
- What data structures are used for test assessments
- Current test data reset functionality
- API endpoints for test user operations

## üìä ANALYSIS REPORT FORMAT

**CREATE FILE: `docs/current-state-verification.md`**

Include this analysis:
