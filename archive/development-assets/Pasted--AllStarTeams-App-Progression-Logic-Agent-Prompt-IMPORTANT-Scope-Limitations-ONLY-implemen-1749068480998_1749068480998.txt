**STICK STRICTLY to the progression rules, completion criteria, and data persistence requirements outlined below.**

## Overview
You are managing a sequential learning progression system for the AllStarTeams workshop app. Users must complete learning steps (step IDs 1-1 through 4-5) in order, with each completion unlocking the next step. Step 4-5 (Final Reflection) is the final learning step, which unlocks all content items in sections 5 and 6. The app contains 6 main sections (Introduction, Discover Your Star Strengths, Identify Your Flow, Visualize Future Growth, NEXT STEPS, MORE INFORMATION). All progress persists across browser sessions and logins via database storage.

## Core Progression Rules

### Initial State
- On first login: Only "Introduction Video" is active, all other sections disabled
- Progress indicators show current completion (e.g., "2/4" means 2 of 4 completed)
- Completed sections display green checkmarks and remain accessible for revisiting

### Video Content Pattern
- **ALL videos auto-play** on section entry
- Minimum 1% watch time required before "Next" button enables
- "Next" button OR video completion triggers progression
- Pattern: Auto-play video + ≥1% + "Next: [Next Section]" → unlock next section

### Assessment Modal Pattern
- Modal assessments collect data through all questions
- Completion shows results screen with "Next: [Next Section]" button
- Results + progression button saves data to database
- Revisiting completed assessments shows results in content view (not assessment)

### Reflection Pattern
- Reflection sections have multiple questions/inputs
- ALL questions must be answered for completion
- Completion unlocks next section
- Data saves to database when section completes

## Activity Type Icons
The app uses existing SVG icons to indicate activity types:
- **Book Icon**: Video content or content with activities
- **Lightning Icon**: Assessments or interactive activities  
- **Pencil Icon**: Reflection/writing activities
