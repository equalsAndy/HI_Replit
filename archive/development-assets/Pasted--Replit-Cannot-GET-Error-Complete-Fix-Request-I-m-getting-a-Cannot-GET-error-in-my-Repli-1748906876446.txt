# Replit "Cannot GET /" Error - Complete Fix Request

I'm getting a "Cannot GET /" error in my Replit app and need you to systematically debug and fix this issue once and for all.

## Please analyze and fix the following:

### 1. **Port Conflict Resolution** 
- **PRIMARY ISSUE**: Multiple server instances are competing for port 5000 (EADDRINUSE errors)
- Check for existing processes using port 5000 and kill them if needed
- Ensure only one server instance is running at a time
- Verify the workflow isn't starting multiple competing processes
- Address EADDRINUSE errors that prevent server startup
- Provide commands to clean up zombie processes

### 2. **Process Management in Replit**
- Check for duplicate or conflicting startup commands
- Verify .replit configuration isn't causing multiple instances
- Ensure proper process cleanup when restarting
- Identify and stop any background processes holding port 5000

### 3. **File Structure & Entry Point**
- Review my `.replit` configuration file for duplicate or conflicting commands
- Check that startup commands aren't creating multiple server instances
- Verify workflow configuration isn't causing process conflicts
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed

### 4. **Development vs Production Environment**
- Verify Vite middleware is properly handling routes in development
- Check that static file serving works correctly in production
- Ensure catch-all route for client-side routing is configured
- Test both development and production builds
- Address environment-specific routing issues

### 5. **Error Handling & Process Cleanup**
- Add proper error handling and logging
- Include startup confirmation messages
- Add middleware for better debugging

## What I need from you:

1. **Diagnose** the specific cause of my error by examining my current code
2. **Provide a complete working solution** with all necessary files
3. **Explain what was wrong** and why the fix works
4. **Include a minimal test route** to verify the fix works
5. **Add proper error handling** to prevent future issues
6. **Ensure Replit-specific compatibility** (correct port, host, file structure)

## Expected deliverables:

- ✅ Port conflict resolution strategy and commands
- ✅ Process management commands for Replit (kill zombie processes)
- ✅ Environment-specific route handling verification
- ✅ Workflow configuration check and fixes
- ✅ Updated `.replit` configuration if needed
- ✅ Clear explanation of what was causing the conflicts
- ✅ Testing instructions to verify the fix
- ✅ Prevention strategies for future port conflicts

Please provide a complete, copy-paste ready solution that will work in Replit's environment. Make sure to include comments explaining the Replit-specific requirements.
