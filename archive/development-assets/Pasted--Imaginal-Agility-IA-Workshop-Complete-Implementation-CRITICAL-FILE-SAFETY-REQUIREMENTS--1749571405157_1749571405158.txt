# Imaginal Agility (IA) Workshop - Complete Implementation

## 🚨 CRITICAL FILE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

### **NEVER MODIFY EXISTING FILES:**
- **DO NOT edit any AST files** - create completely new files for IA
- **DO NOT modify existing navigation components** - create new IA navigation component
- **DO NOT change existing routes** - create new `/imaginal-agility` routes
- **DO NOT alter existing components** - duplicate and rename for IA use

### **FILE CREATION STRATEGY:**
- **Create new directory**: `client/src/components/imaginal-agility/`
- **New navigation component**: `ImaginalAgilityNavigation.tsx` (copy AST structure)
- **New page component**: `ImaginalAgilityPage.tsx` (copy AST page structure)
- **New route handlers**: For `/imaginal-agility` paths
- **Separate database schemas**: IA-specific assessment types with `appType: "ia"`

## 🎯 LAYOUT REPLICATION TARGET

**Reference the uploaded AST layout image (yellow header, left navigation menu)**

### **Structure to Copy (EXACT):**
- **Header bar position and size**
- **Left navigation menu placement and organization**
- **Main content area layout and proportions**
- **Video player area positioning**
- **Progress indicators format**
- **Overall spacing and component arrangement**

### **Styling to Adapt (IA BRANDING):**
- **Navigation colors**: Use purple Imaginal Agility color scheme (not AST colors)
- **Navigation styling**: Purple/blue gradient theme consistent with IA branding
- **IA logo**: Use existing IA logo from landing page for workshop headers
- **Typography**: Maintain readability but use IA brand colors

Welcome.
Einstein said imagination is more important than knowledge. This workshop shows you why — and how to use yours more intentionally.

As AI reshapes the workplace, the ability to imagine clearly and purposefully is your edge. It's the one human capability AI can't replace or optimize.

This Micro Course is your starting point.

You'll move at your own pace: watch short videos, follow simple prompts, and complete structured exercises.

It's the first step in building Imaginal Agility — a skillset for navigating change, solving problems, and creating value.

Next, you'll meet with your team to turn fresh insight into shared breakthroughs.

You're not just learning about imagination. You're harnessing it — together.

```
As organizations face what Deloitte identifies as an "imagination deficit" in the AI era, robust imagination self-assessment becomes essential for maintaining human creative agency and fostering transformative innovation capacity.

This Self-Assessment helps participants to reflect on their five core capabilities essential for personal growth, team synergy, and collaborative intelligence:

• Imagination
• Curiosity  
• Empathy
• Creativity
• Courage

Your responses will generate a visual radar map for reflection and use in the Teamwork Practice Session. The process should take about 10–15 minutes.

REALITY DISCERNMENT

Train Your Mind to Know What's Real.

In an age of AI-generated content, deepfakes, and digital manipulation, discernment is no longer optional — it's essential.

This short learning experience introduces you to the neuroscience behind reality monitoring — the brain's ability to tell what's real from what's imagined — and offers practical tools.

What You'll Learn:
• Why imagination is your first line of cognitive defense
• How AI content bypasses our natural filters
• What neuroscience reveals about perception and deception
• How to track your own AI interaction patterns in real time

What You'll Practice:
• The AI Mirror Test — a powerful self-reflection tool to observe your own thinking habits in AI interaction
• Real vs. Fake visual discernment challenge
• Discernment Toolkit — 5 simple questions to strengthen daily clarity

Why It Matters:
"You can't depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus." — Mark Twain

THE AI MIRROR TEST
A 3-Phase Self-Awareness Tool for Conscious AI Collaboration

The AI Mirror Test is a professional-grade reflection tool to help you assess the quality of your engagement with AI. It supports development of HaiQ (Human-AI Intelligence Quotient) by guiding you through a 3-phase cycle:

Phase 1: Pre-Reflection — Name the Frame
Before you begin interacting with AI, take a moment to answer:
1. What is your primary intention in this AI interaction? (solve, explore, validate?)
2. What do you expect the AI to do well — or poorly?
3. Are you entering this as a co-creator, consumer, or critic?

Phase 2: Active Observation — Catch Yourself in the Act
During your interaction with AI, gently observe:
1. Did you revise your prompt at all, or accept the first response?
2. Did you question anything the AI produced?
3. What did you *not* say or ask that shaped the result?

Phase 3: Post-Reflection — What Did I Miss?
After your AI interaction, take 1–2 minutes to reflect:
1. What surprised you about your own behavior?
2. Did AI help you think more clearly — or just faster?
3. What will you do differently next time?

Self-Assessment Practice
Rate your interaction on these 5 dimensions (0 = not at all, 10 = fully):

• Agency — How much did you direct the interaction?
• Reflection — Did you notice your own patterns and revise?
• Imaginative Initiative — Did you use the AI to expand your thinking?
• Clarity — Did the interaction help clarify your ideas?
• Discernment — Did you evaluate AI outputs with critical thinking?

This is a learning tool you can practice with any AI interaction to develop stronger discernment skills and more conscious collaboration with AI systems.

The Neuroscience Behind Imaginal Agility

Built for Every Mind
Imagination isn't one-size-fits-all. The method supports diverse cognitive styles — including visual, verbal, emotional, and neurodivergent profiles.

Why It Works
• Our method activates real brain systems — not just ideas.
• Each practice is designed to strengthen imagination as a core cognitive capability.

What the Science Shows
• Mental synthesis fuses stored images into new ideas
• Five brain systems power imagination: memory, planning, empathy, fluency, vision
• Repetition builds clarity, agility, and insight
• Trained imagination improves reality discernment

From Neurons to Organizational Brilliance
The same neural process that sparks individual insight scales to team alignment and cultural change.

}
```

## 🎨 IA BRANDING AND STYLING

### **Header Strategy (SAFE):**
- **Keep existing app header unchanged** (yellow with Heliotrope logo)
- **IA workshop content headers**: Use existing IA logo + "Imaginal Agility Workshop Course > Step Name"
- **IA Logo path**: Use existing IA logo from landing page (find in system)

### **IA Navigation Styling:**
- **Color scheme**: Purple/blue gradient (Imaginal Agility brand colors)
- **Navigation background**: Purple theme (not AST yellow/colors)
- **Progress indicators**: Purple/blue styling for IA workshop
- **Layout structure**: Copy AST navigation layout exactly
- **Icons**: 🎥 🔍 ⚡ 📊 📖 for respective step types

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Database Separation:**
```javascript
// IA Navigation Progress
users.navigationProgress = {
  appType: "ia",                    // Separate from AST's "ast"
  completedSteps: ["ia-1-1"],       // IA step completion
  currentStepId: "ia-2-1",          // Current IA step
  unlockedSteps: ["ia-1-1", "ia-2-1"], // Unlocked IA steps
  videoProgress: {                  // Track for analytics only
    "ia-1-1": { farthest: 90.0, current: 45.0 }
  }
}
```

### **Progression Logic:**
- **Same as current AST**: "Next" button clicks mark steps complete
- **Video auto-play**: Track progress for analytics only (no progression requirements)
- **Green checkmarks**: Appear when user clicks "Next" or completes assessment
- **Sequential unlocking**: Complete ia-1-1 to unlock ia-2-1, etc.
- **Assessment completion**: All 20 questions answered enables next step

### **Component Architecture:**
