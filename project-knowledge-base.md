# Heliotrope Imaginal - Project Knowledge Base

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

**Heliotrope Imaginal** is a dual-workshop platform with shared infrastructure and distinct workshop experiences:

- **Overall Platform**: Heliotrope Imaginal (yellow header bar)
- **AST Workshop**: AllStarTeams (blue theme, numbered step IDs)
- **IA Workshop**: Imaginal Agility (purple theme, ia- prefixed step IDs)
- **Shared Features**: Admin dashboards, facilitator tools, authentication

## âœ… Environment Status (June 2025)
- **Claude Code**: âœ… Installed and operational
- **Git Performance**: âœ… Fast (0.093s operations)
- **iCloud Protection**: âœ… Active (.git excluded)
- **File Access**: âœ… Claude direct editing confirmed

## ðŸ’¡ User Communication Preferences
- **Adaptive Step Delivery**: Single step when Claude needs output verification, multiple steps when sequential and independent
- **Development Context**: Uses Replit Agent for complex changes, Claude for simple changes, Claude Code for analysis

## ðŸ¤– Replit Assistant Integration

**When to Request Assistant Help:**
- Complex file system analysis (finding/auditing components)
- Multi-file code pattern identification  
- Current implementation discovery
- Performance/behavior assessment
- Architecture mapping
- Video/component inconsistency analysis

**Assistant Request Template:**
"Please analyze [specific aspect] in this project and provide [specific deliverable].
Focus on [key constraints/requirements]."

**Claude Focus Areas After Assistant Analysis:**
- Strategy and planning based on Assistant findings
- Risk assessment and mitigation  
- Implementation prompt creation for Replit Agent
- Documentation synthesis and architectural recommendations

**Example Workflow:**
1. **Assistant**: "Analyze video implementations across workshops"
2. **Claude**: Creates standardization strategy and Replit Agent prompts
3. **Replit Agent**: Executes implementation based on Claude's plan

**Benefits:**
- âœ… Saves Claude message limits for strategy work
- âœ… Leverages Assistant's direct code access
- âœ… Focuses Claude on high-value synthesis
- âœ… Creates efficient discovery â†’ planning â†’ implementation workflow
