# Imaginal Agility (IA) Workshop Implementation - Complete Prompt v80

## 🚨 CRITICAL FILE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS

### **NEVER MODIFY EXISTING FILES:**
- **DO NOT edit any AST files** - create completely new files for IA
- **DO NOT modify existing navigation components** - create new IA navigation component
- **DO NOT change existing routes** - create new `/imaginal-agility` routes
- **DO NOT alter existing components** - duplicate and rename for IA use

### **ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS BEFORE CHANGING FILES**
Before making any code changes, please ask clarifying questions about:
- File locations and existing code structure
- Component dependencies and imports
- Database schemas and API endpoints
- Any uncertainty about implementation approach

## 🎯 CORE REQUIREMENT: COPY AST LAYOUT EXACTLY

**Look at the AST layout structure and copy it EXACTLY but replace content with IA content.**

### **Layout Replication Requirements:**
- **Yellow header bar** (keep existing app header with Heliotrope logo)
- **Left navigation menu** with same positioning and organization
- **Main content area** with same proportions and structure
- **Video player area** with same positioning
- **Progress indicators** in same format as AST

### **What to Copy vs Replace:**
- **COPY**: Layout structure, positioning, proportions, navigation organization
- **REPLACE**: Content text, step names, colors (use IA purple scheme), step IDs

## 🎨 IA BRANDING REQUIREMENTS

### **Color Scheme:**
- **Navigation**: Purple/blue gradient theme (not AST colors)
- **Main content**: IA purple branding throughout
- **Header bar**: Keep existing (Heliotrope logo in yellow header)

### **Logo Integration:**
- **IA Logo**: Use `attached_assets/imaginal_agility_logo_nobkgrd.png`
- **Usage**: Workshop content headers only
- **Format**: "Imaginal Agility Workshop Course > [Step Name]"

### **Responsive Design:**
- **All components must be fully responsive**
- **Mobile-first approach**
- **Breakpoints**: Mobile (320px+), Tablet (768px+), Desktop (1024px+)
- **Navigation**: Collapsible on mobile
- **Video players**: Responsive sizing
- **Assessment interface**: Touch-friendly on mobile

## 📺 VIDEO INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

### **Video Embed Structure:**
All videos must use this exact iframe structure:
```html
<iframe 
  width="832" 
  height="468" 
  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/[VIDEO_ID]" 
  title="[VIDEO_TITLE]" 
  frameborder="0" 
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" 
  referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" 
  allowfullscreen
  className="w-full h-auto aspect-video max-w-4xl mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg"
></iframe>
```

### **Responsive Video Styling:**
- **Container**: Max width 832px, responsive scaling
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 maintained on all screen sizes
- **Mobile**: Full width with proper scaling

Welcome.

Einstein said imagination is more important than knowledge. This workshop shows you why — and how to use yours more intentionally.

As AI reshapes the workplace, the ability to imagine clearly and purposefully is your edge. It's the one human capability AI can't replace or optimize.

This Micro Course is your starting point.

You'll move at your own pace: watch short videos, follow simple prompts, and complete structured exercises.

It's the first step in building Imaginal Agility — a skillset for navigating change, solving problems, and creating value.

Next, you'll meet with your team to turn fresh insight into shared breakthroughs.

You're not just learning about imagination. You're harnessing it — together.

- **Instructions**:
```
As organizations face what Deloitte identifies as an "imagination deficit" in the AI era, robust imagination self-assessment becomes essential for maintaining human creative agency and fostering transformative innovation capacity.

This Self-Assessment helps participants to reflect on their five core capabilities essential for personal growth, team synergy, and collaborative intelligence:

• Imagination
• Curiosity  
• Empathy
• Creativity
• Courage

Your responses will generate a visual radar map for reflection and use in the Teamwork Practice Session. The process should take about 10–15 minutes.

Review Your Imagination Radar

You've just completed your self-assessment. Now it's time to explore your results.

Your Radar Map reveals how five essential human capabilities show up in your life and work.

What This Is
• A snapshot, not a scorecard
• A reflection tool, not a judgment
• A way to see patterns and possibilities

What Comes Next
You'll bring this Radar into the next phase: the Team Practice Session, where it becomes a foundation for shared insight, creative alignment, and collaboration with AI.

Real-Time Co-Creation
• You'll brainstorm, align, and design solutions together — rapidly and with purpose.

Human + AI Synergy
• You'll raise your HaiQ — the ability to stay imaginative, collaborative, and human while working with AI.

What You Leave With
• A shared model for alignment and trust
• Tools and language to apply imagination at scale
• Personal and team AI insights and prompt packs
• Clearer team identity and action direction

REALITY DISCERNMENT

Train Your Mind to Know What's Real.

In an age of AI-generated content, deepfakes, and digital manipulation, discernment is no longer optional — it's essential.

This short learning experience introduces you to the neuroscience behind reality monitoring — the brain's ability to tell what's real from what's imagined — and offers practical tools.

THE AI MIRROR TEST
A 3-Phase Self-Awareness Tool for Conscious AI Collaboration

The AI Mirror Test is a professional-grade reflection tool to help you assess the quality of your engagement with AI. It supports development of HaiQ (Human-AI Intelligence Quotient) by guiding you through a 3-phase cycle:

Phase 1: Pre-Reflection — Name the Frame
Before you begin interacting with AI, take a moment to answer:
1. What is your primary intention in this AI interaction? (solve, explore, validate?)
2. What do you expect the AI to do well — or poorly?
3. Are you entering this as a co-creator, consumer, or critic?

Phase 2: Active Observation — Catch Yourself in the Act
During your interaction with AI, gently observe:
1. Did you revise your prompt at all, or accept the first response?
2. Did you question anything the AI produced?
3. What did you *not* say or ask that shaped the result?

Phase 3: Post-Reflection — What Did I Miss?
After your AI interaction, take 1–2 minutes to reflect:
1. What surprised you about your own behavior?
2. Did AI help you think more clearly — or just faster?
3. What will you do differently next time?

Self-Assessment Practice
Rate your interaction on these 5 dimensions (0 = not at all, 10 = fully):

• Agency — How much did you direct the interaction?
• Reflection — Did you notice your own patterns and revise?
• Imaginative Initiative — Did you use the AI to expand your thinking?
• Clarity — Did the interaction help clarify your ideas?
• Discernment — Did you evaluate AI outputs with critical thinking?

This is a learning tool you can practice with any AI interaction to develop stronger discernment skills and more conscious collaboration with AI systems.

The Neuroscience Behind Imaginal Agility

Built for Every Mind
Imagination isn't one-size-fits-all. The method supports diverse cognitive styles — including visual, verbal, emotional, and neurodivergent profiles.

Why It Works
• Our method activates real brain systems — not just ideas.
• Each practice is designed to strengthen imagination as a core cognitive capability.

What the Science Shows
• Mental synthesis fuses stored images into new ideas
• Five brain systems power imagination: memory, planning, empathy, fluency, vision
• Repetition builds clarity, agility, and insight
• Trained imagination improves reality discernment

From Neurons to Organizational Brilliance
The same neural process that sparks individual insight scales to team alignment and cultural change.

## 🔒 FILE SAFETY PROTOCOL

### **File Verification Before Changes:**
1. **Double-check file path** - ensure working in IA directory, not AST
2. **Verify file purpose** - confirm it's for IA, not shared/AST functionality
3. **Check for duplicates** - ensure editing correct file when similar names exist
4. **Validate file contents** - read file before editing to confirm correct target

### **During Implementation:**
- **Regular check-ins** after each file modification
- **Verify paths** when working with similar component names
- **Ask questions** when uncertain about file relationships

### **Common Confusion Prevention:**
- **Navigation files**: AST vs IA navigation components
- **Assessment components**: Existing vs new IA assessment
- **Content views**: Ensure in IA directory, not AST
- **Route files**: IA routes vs AST routes
