Perfect debugging approach! The assistant has set up comprehensive logging to track the entire flow. Let me implement these debugging changes to identify where the chain breaks.
Since this involves debugging changes to 2 files, this is appropriate for Replit Agent:
REPLIT AGENT: Logo Debug Implementation
✅ VERIFIED ENVIRONMENT: Ready for debugging modifications
🎯 OBJECTIVE: Add comprehensive debugging to identify logo display issue
Problem: IA workshop still shows AST logo despite route detection fix
Strategy: Add logging at each step in the chain to find the break point
📂 MODIFY EXACTLY 2 FILES:
File 1: client/src/pages/allstarteams.tsx

ADD: Console logging for route detection and app type setting (+11 lines)
Debug Flow: URL → currentAppType → currentApp → isImaginalAgility prop

File 2: client/src/components/navigation/UserHomeNavigationWithStarCard.tsx

ADD: Console logging for received props (+7 lines)
MODIFY: Temporarily hardcode Logo to type="imaginal-agility" (-2 lines)
Purpose: Test if Logo component itself works correctly

🔧 IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
Debugging Code to Add:
In allstarteams.tsx useEffect:
tsxconst currentAppType = location.includes('/imaginal-agility') ? 'imaginal-agility' : 'allstarteams';
console.log('🔍 DEBUG - Current path:', location.pathname);
console.log('🔍 DEBUG - Setting app to:', currentAppType);
setCurrentApp(currentAppType);

// Also debug the isImaginalAgility calculation
console.log('🔍 DEBUG - currentApp:', currentApp);
console.log('🔍 DEBUG - isImaginalAgility will be:', currentApp === 'imaginal-agility');
In UserHomeNavigationWithStarCard.tsx:
tsx// At the top of component function
console.log('🔍 NAV DEBUG - Received isImaginalAgility:', isImaginalAgility);

// Temporarily hardcode the Logo
<Logo
  type="imaginal-agility"  // <-- Hardcoded for testing
  className="h-12 w-auto mx-auto"
/>
⚠️ CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:

❌ These are temporary debugging changes - will revert after identifying issue
✅ ONLY add console.log statements and temporary hardcode
✅ DO NOT modify core logic beyond debugging
✅ PRESERVE all existing functionality

🧪 TESTING PROTOCOL:
After implementation:

Navigate to /imaginal-agility
Open browser console
Look for debug output:

What path is detected?
What app type is set?
What isImaginalAgility value is passed?
Does hardcoded IA logo display correctly?



📋 SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✅ Debug output appears in console when navigating to IA workshop
✅ Hardcoded IA logo displays (confirms Logo component works)
✅ Chain tracking working - can see each step in the flow
✅ Issue location identified - where the chain breaks
EXECUTE DEBUGGING IMPLEMENTATION TO IDENTIFY LOGO ISSUE ROOT CAUSE.
