REPLIT AGENT: Workshop Locking System - Phase 1 Database Schema
üéØ Task: Add Workshop Completion Tracking to Database Schema
You need to add workshop completion status fields to the existing users table in the AllStarTeams application. This will track when users complete AST or IA workshops and prevent further edits.
üìÅ Files to Modify
Primary File: shared/schema.ts
REQUIRED CHANGES:

Add new fields to the users table schema (around line where other boolean fields are defined):

typescript// Workshop completion tracking
astWorkshopCompleted: boolean('ast_workshop_completed').default(false).notNull(),
iaWorkshopCompleted: boolean('ia_workshop_completed').default(false).notNull(),
astCompletedAt: timestamp('ast_completed_at'),
iaCompletedAt: timestamp('ia_completed_at'),
EXACT PLACEMENT: Add these fields after the existing access control fields (astAccess, iaAccess) and before the facilitator console fields (assignedFacilitatorId).
üîß Implementation Requirements
Database Schema Pattern

Follow the existing naming convention in the file
Use boolean fields with .default(false).notNull() for completion status
Use nullable timestamp fields for completion dates
Maintain consistent field ordering with other table definitions

Field Specifications:

astWorkshopCompleted: Boolean, defaults to false, not null
iaWorkshopCompleted: Boolean, defaults to false, not null
astCompletedAt: Timestamp, nullable (null until workshop completed)
iaCompletedAt: Timestamp, nullable (null until workshop completed)

‚úÖ Success Criteria

Schema Integration: New fields properly integrated into existing users table schema
Type Safety: Fields follow existing TypeScript patterns in the file
Naming Convention: Field names match the camelCase pattern used elsewhere
Default Values: Boolean fields have proper defaults and null constraints
File Integrity: No syntax errors, proper imports maintained

üö® Critical Requirements

PRESERVE ALL EXISTING FIELDS: Do not modify or remove any existing user table fields
MAINTAIN IMPORTS: Keep all existing imports at the top of the file
FOLLOW PATTERNS: Use the exact same pattern as other boolean and timestamp fields in the schema
NO BREAKING CHANGES: Ensure the changes don't break existing database queries

üîç Validation Steps
After making changes:

Verify the file has no TypeScript errors
Confirm all existing fields remain unchanged
Check that the new fields follow the established patterns
Ensure proper formatting and indentation

The schema changes will be used by the database migration system to add these columns to the production database. These fields will then be used by the frontend workshop locking system to track completion status.
