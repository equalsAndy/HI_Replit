✅ VERIFIED ENVIRONMENT: Ready for modifications
TARGET: IA Workshop Content Fixes Only

File: client/src/components/content/imaginal-agility/ImaginalAgilityContent.tsx
Scope: Single file modification, IA workshop only

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:

❌ DO NOT modify AST files or navigation data
❌ DO NOT change step IDs or navigation structure
✅ ONLY fix content within ImaginalAgilityContent.tsx

FIXES REQUIRED:
1. Remove Logo/Title Headers from ALL Content Views

Remove any IA logo imports and header cards with "Imaginal Agility Workshop Course"
Keep only clean step titles (e.g., "Introduction to Imaginal Agility")

2. Fix Graphics in ia-3-1

Change ALL image paths from /assets/ to /public/assets/ or verify correct asset paths

3. Fix Step Progression Flow
Based on navigationData.ts structure:

ia-1-1 → ia-2-1 (Introduction → Triple Challenge)
ia-2-1 → ia-3-1 (Triple Challenge → Solution)
ia-3-1 → ia-4-1 (Solution → Self-Assessment)
ia-4-1 → ia-5-1 (Assessment → Assessment Results)
ia-5-1 → ia-6-1 (Assessment Results → Teamwork Preparation)
ia-6-1 → ia-8-1 (Teamwork Preparation → Neuroscience)

4. Remove Non-Existent ia-4-2 Step

Delete the entire ia-4-2 case block
No step should reference ia-4-2

5. Fix Step Content Titles

ia-5-1: Should be "Assessment Results" not "Teamwork Preparation"
ia-6-1: Should be "Teamwork Preparation" not "Discernment Guide"

6. Add Complete Workshop Modal to ia-8-1

Replace the simple alert() with a proper modal like AST final reflection
Modal should congratulate completion but have NO next steps
Use purple IA theme for modal styling

VERIFICATION:

All IA steps have clean headers (no logo/course title)
Graphics in ia-3-1 load properly
Next buttons follow correct progression flow
ia-8-1 has Complete Workshop modal
No references to ia-4-2 exist

MODIFY ONLY THE IA CONTENT COMPONENT - NO OTHER FILES.
