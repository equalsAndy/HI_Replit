  - Core Capabilities assessment (10-15 minutes## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

After implementation:
- [ ] **Complete separation**: IA workshop works independently of AST
- [ ] **Same UX patterns**: Users familiar with AST can navigate IA easily  
- [ ] **Data persistence**: All IA inputs save and restore properly
- [ ] **Progress tracking**: Sequential unlocking works for IA steps (ia-1-1 through ia-8-1)
- [ ] **Assessment functionality**: Core capabilities assessment with radar chart results
- [ ] **Video integration**: All 9 IA videos play with progress tracking using same thresholds as AST
- [ ] **Discernment training**: Complete reality testing toolkit with practice exercises
- [ ] **Team collaboration**: Whiteboard access and team breakthrough functionality
- [ ] **Neuroscience foundation**: Brain science content accessible and interactive
- [ ] **Admin capability**: IA data can be reset independently from AST### 1. Navigation System Replication:

- **Separate step validation** using IA step IDs (`ia-X-Y` format)
- **Independent unlocking system** (IA steps don't affect AST)
- **Content-based progression**: Some steps may be content/reflection rather than video-based
- **Same auto-save patterns**: Assessment data (immediate), reflection text (1s debounce)

### 2. Component Architecture:
- **Duplicate# Imaginal Agility (IA) Workshop Implementation - Phased Approach

## 🚨 CRITICAL: AST PRESERVATION REQUIREMENTS

### ✅ **DO NOT MODIFY AST:**
- **Keep all existing AST step IDs unchanged**: "1-1", "2-3", "3-4", etc. (NO "ast-" prefixes)
- **Keep all AST database structure exactly as is**
- **Keep all AST components and logic untouched**
- **AST continues using appType: "ast"** with existing step IDs

### ✅ **IA IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:**
- **IA uses NEW step IDs**: "ia-1-1", "ia-2-1", "ia-3-1", etc. (WITH "ia-" prefixes)
- **IA uses appType: "ia"** for complete separation
- **IA replicates AST logic patterns** without modifying AST code
- **No cross-contamination** between AST and IA data

### Database Separation Strategy:
```javascript
// AST (UNCHANGED)
users.navigationProgress = {
  appType: "ast",
  completedSteps: ["1-1", "2-1", "2-2"], // Keep existing format
  currentStepId: "2-3",
  // ... rest unchanged
}

// IA (NEW)  
users.navigationProgress = {
  appType: "ia", 
  completedSteps: ["ia-1-1", "ia-2-1"], // New prefixed format
  currentStepId: "ia-2-1",
  // ... new structure
}
```

## 🎯 PHASE 1 DETAILED REQUIREMENTS

### IA Navigation Progression Rules (SIMPLIFIED - Different from AST):

#### Video Steps Pattern:
- **Auto-play video** on section entry
- **Track video progress** in database (for analytics/data)
- **Video progress does NOT affect menu progression/unlocking**
- **Next button always enabled** (no video progress requirements)
- **Green checkmark appears** when user clicks "Next" button

#### Assessment Steps Pattern:
- **Complete assessment** to enable Next button
- **Green checkmark appears** when assessment is completed
- **Assessment completion enables Next button**

#### Content Steps Pattern:
- **Next button always enabled** (immediate viewing)
- **Green checkmark appears** when user clicks "Next" button

#### Next Button Rules:
- **Format**: "Next: [Exact Menu Item Name]"
- **Video/Content Steps**: Next button always enabled, clicking "Next" marks complete
- **Assessment Steps**: Next button enabled when assessment complete, completion marks step complete

#### IA Step Sequence for Phase 1:
```
ia-1-1: Introduction to Imaginal Agility (VIDEO STEP)
  ↓ (unlocks when user clicks "Next")
ia-2-1: The Triple Challenge (VIDEO STEP) 
  ↓ (unlocks when user clicks "Next")
ia-3-1: Imaginal Agility Solution (VIDEO STEP)
  ↓ (unlocks when user clicks "Next")  
ia-4-1: Self-Assessment (ASSESSMENT STEP)
  ↓ (unlocks when assessment completed)
ia-4-2: Review Results (CONTENT STEP)
  ↓ (unlocks when user clicks "Next")
```

**Note**: Much simpler than AST's video progress thresholds - IA uses "Next" button progression

**Note**: AST keeps its existing step IDs unchanged ("1-1", "2-3", "3-4", etc.)

### Database Schema for Phase 1:

```javascript
// AST (COMPLETELY UNCHANGED)
users.navigationProgress = {
  completedSteps: ["1-1", "2-1"],     // Existing AST format
  currentStepId: "2-2",               // Existing AST format  
  appType: "ast",                     // Existing AST identifier
  // ... all existing AST structure preserved (including video progress thresholds)
}

// IA (NEW IMPLEMENTATION - SIMPLIFIED PROGRESSION)
users.navigationProgress = {
  completedSteps: ["ia-1-1"],         // NEW IA format - marked complete when "Next" clicked
  currentStepId: "ia-2-1",            // NEW IA format  
  appType: "ia",                      // NEW IA identifier
  lastVisitedAt: "2025-06-04T...",
  unlockedSteps: ["ia-1-1", "ia-2-1"], // Unlocked by "Next" clicks or assessment completion
  videoProgress: {                    // Tracked for analytics only, not progression
    "ia-1-1": { farthest: 90.0, current: 45.0 },
    "ia-2-1": { farthest: 15.0, current: 15.0 }
  }
}

// userAssessments for IA (NEW)
assessmentType: 'iaCoreCabilities' → {
  imagination: number,
  curiosity: number,  
  empathy: number,
  creativity: number,
  courage: number,
  responses: object,
  radarChart: object
}
```

### Progression Logic Differences:
- **AST**: Video progress thresholds (5%/90%) control progression and green checkmarks
- **IA**: "Next" button clicks and assessment completion control progression and green checkmarks
- **IA Video Progress**: Tracked for data/analytics but doesn't affect menu progression

## ❓ CLARIFYING QUESTIONS FOR PHASE 1

### **1. Content Implementation Priority**
Which IA section should I implement first?
- **Option A**: "Introduction to Imaginal Agility" (ia-1-1) - Video + content, simple foundation test
- **Option B**: "Self-Assessment" (ia-4-1) - Assessment system, more complex but shows progression

### **2. Step Types Confirmation** 
Based on IA content, are these step types correct?
- **Video Steps**: ia-1-1, ia-2-1, ia-3-1, ia-4-2, ia-5-1, ia-6-1, ia-7-1 (auto-play, "Next" to complete)
- **Assessment Step**: ia-4-1 (Core Capabilities - assessment completion required)
- **Content Steps**: Others (just viewing content, "Next" to complete)

### **3. IA Route Structure**
Should IA be accessible via:
- Separate URL like `/imaginal-agility`?
- Completely separate navigation component?
- Own progress tracking system?

### **4. Video Integration Approach**
For IA videos, I'll:
- **Auto-play videos** ✅
- **Track video progress** in database for analytics ✅
- **No video progress thresholds** for progression ✅
- **"Next" button always enabled** for video steps ✅
- **Green checkmark on "Next" click** ✅

### **5. Assessment Integration**
For IA assessments, I'll:
- **Copy AST assessment patterns** ✅
- **Auto-save assessment responses** ✅
- **Enable "Next" when assessment complete** ✅
- **Green checkmark on assessment completion** ✅

## 🚀 READY TO START PHASE 1

Once you clarify these questions, I can begin implementing Phase 1 with:
✅ Database architecture for IA separation  
✅ Navigation system with IA progression  
✅ First content section with video integration  
✅ Next button functionality following AST patterns  
✅ Foundation for remaining phases

**What's your preference for the questions above?**

## 📋 CONTEXT: Existing AST System to Replicate

### Current AST Architecture (DO NOT MODIFY)
The existing AllStarTeams workshop uses a sophisticated progression system:

#### Database Structure:
- **users.navigationProgress** JSON field stores all progression data
- **userAssessments** table stores assessment responses  
- **appType separation**: AST uses `"ast"`, IA will use `"ia"`
- **Auto-save system**: Text inputs (1-second debounce), assessments (immediate)

#### AST Navigation Pattern:
```javascript
users.navigationProgress = {
  completedSteps: ["1-1", "2-1", "2-2"], // Completed step IDs
  currentStepId: "2-3",                   // Current active step
  appType: "ast",                         // Workshop type ("ast" vs "ia")
  lastVisitedAt: "2025-06-04T...",       // Last access timestamp
  unlockedSteps: ["1-1", "2-1", "2-2", "2-3"], // Accessible steps
  videoProgress: {                        // Video watch percentages
    "1-1": { farthest: 85.3, current: 23.7 },
    "2-1": { farthest: 100.0, current: 100.0 }
  }
}
```

#### AST Progression Rules:
- **Sequential unlocking**: Must complete steps in order (1-1 → 2-1 → 2-2 → etc.)
- **Video thresholds**: 5% farthest progress unlocks next step, 90% shows green checkmark
- **Assessment completion**: All required fields completed before progression
- **Text reflection completion**: All questions answered (non-empty strings)
- **Auto-save persistence**: All user inputs preserved across sessions

#### AST Section Structure (6 sections):
1. **Introduction** (1 step): Introduction video
2. **Discover Your Star Strengths** (4 steps): Video → Assessment → Preview → Reflection
3. **Identify Your Flow** (4 steps): Video → Assessment → Reflection → Word Selection
4. **Visualize Your Potential** (5 steps): Ladder → Reflections → Visualizing → Future Self → Final
5. **Next Steps** (resources): Workshop guide, reports
6. **More Information** (resources): Additional materials

    • The AI Mirror Test — a powerful self-reflection tool to observe your own thinking habits in AI interaction
    • Real vs. Fake visual discernment challenge
    • Discernment Toolkit — 5 simple questions to strengthen daily clarity

    Why It Matters:
    "You can't depend on your eyes when your imagination is out of focus." — Mark Twain

    THE AI MIRROR TEST
    A 3-Phase Self-Awareness Tool for Conscious AI Collaboration

    The AI Mirror Test is a professional-grade reflection tool to help you assess the quality of your engagement with AI. It supports development of HaiQ (Human-AI Intelligence Quotient) by guiding you through a 3-phase cycle:

    Phase 1: Pre-Reflection — Name the Frame
    Before you begin interacting with AI, take a moment to answer:
    1. What is your primary intention in this AI interaction? (solve, explore, validate?)
    2. What do you expect the AI to do well — or poorly?
    3. Are you entering this as a co-creator, consumer, or critic?

    Phase 2: Active Observation — Catch Yourself in the Act
    During your interaction with AI, gently observe:
    1. Did you revise your prompt at all, or accept the first response?
    2. Did you question anything the AI produced?
    3. What did you *not* say or ask that shaped the result?

    Phase 3: Post-Reflection — What Did I Miss?
    After your AI interaction, take 1–2 minutes to reflect:
    1. What surprised you about your own behavior?
    2. Did AI help you think more clearly — or just faster?
    3. What will you do differently next time?

    Self-Assessment Practice
    Rate your interaction on these 5 dimensions (0 = not at all, 10 = fully):

    • Agency — How much did you direct the interaction?
    • Reflection — Did you notice your own patterns and revise?
    • Imaginative Initiative — Did you use the AI to expand your thinking?
    • Clarity — Did the interaction help clarify your ideas?
    • Discernment — Did you evaluate AI outputs with critical thinking?

    This is a learning tool you can practice with any AI interaction to develop stronger discernment skills and more conscious collaboration with AI systems.

    The Neuroscience Behind Imaginal Agility

    Built for Every Mind
    Imagination isn't one-size-fits-all. The method supports diverse cognitive styles — including visual, verbal, emotional, and neurodivergent profiles.

    Why It Works
    • Our method activates real brain systems — not just ideas.
    • Each practice is designed to strengthen imagination as a core cognitive capability.

    What the Science Shows
    • Mental synthesis fuses stored images into new ideas
    • Five brain systems power imagination: memory, planning, empathy, fluency, vision
    • Repetition builds clarity, agility, and insight
    • Trained imagination improves reality discernment

    From Neurons to Organizational Brilliance
    The same neural process that sparks individual insight scales to team alignment and cultural change.

}
```

#### IA Navigation Progress:
```javascript
users.navigationProgress = {
  completedSteps: ["ia-1-1", "ia-2-1", "ia-4-1"], // IA step IDs with "ia-" prefix
  currentStepId: "ia-4-2",                        // Current IA step  
  appType: "ia",                                  // Separate from AST ("ast")
  lastVisitedAt: "2025-06-04T...",               // Last access
  unlockedSteps: ["ia-1-1", "ia-2-1", "ia-3-1", "ia-4-1", "ia-4-2"], // Accessible IA steps
  videoProgress: {                                // IA video progress (if videos present)
    "ia-1-1": { farthest: 90.0, current: 45.0 },
    "ia-2-1": { farthest: 15.0, current: 15.0 }
  },
  whiteboardAccess: boolean,                      // Team whiteboard access granted
  discernmentLevel: number,                       // Reality discernment skill level
  teamSessionComplete: boolean                    // Collaborative session completion
}
```

### IA Step ID Convention:
Use `"ia-X-Y"` format to distinguish from AST's `"X-Y"` format:
- IA Step 1-1 → `"ia-1-1"`
- IA Step 2-3 → `"ia-2-3"`
- etc.

### API Endpoints for IA:
Create parallel endpoints with IA-specific paths:
```

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. Navigation System Replication:
- **Copy AST progression logic** for IA with `appType: "ia"`
- **Separate step validation** using IA step IDs
- **Independent unlocking system** (IA steps don't affect AST)
- **Same video thresholds**: 5% unlock, 90% complete
- **Same auto-save patterns**: Text (1s debounce), assessments (immediate)

### 2. Component Architecture:
- **Duplicate AST components** with IA-specific naming
- **IA-specific content** from provided files
- **Radar chart visualization** for assessment results
- **Progress indicators** showing IA completion status
- **Menu separation** (IA workshop separate from AST)

### 3. Data Isolation:
- **No cross-contamination** between AST and IA data
- **Separate route handling** for IA workshop access
- **Independent progress tracking** and completion states
- **Parallel admin reset** functionality for IA data only

### 4. User Experience:
- **Same UI patterns** as AST for consistency
- **IA-specific branding** and content
- **Radar chart results** instead of star card
- **Reflection integration** with imagination development focus

## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
1. Create IA-specific database schemas and API endpoints
2. Set up IA navigation system with `appType: "ia"`
3. Implement basic IA step progression (copy AST logic)
4. Test data isolation between AST and IA

### Phase 2: Content Implementation  
1. Build IA workshop pages using provided video/content files
2. Implement IA imagination assessment with Likert scales
3. Create radar chart visualization for results
4. Add IA-specific reflection components

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Complete auto-save functionality for all IA inputs
2. Implement video progress tracking for IA
3. Add IA completion tracking and green checkmarks
4. Create IA-specific admin reset functionality

## ✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA

After implementation:
- [ ] **Complete separation**: IA workshop works independently of AST
- [ ] **Same UX patterns**: Users familiar with AST can navigate IA easily  
- [ ] **Data persistence**: All IA inputs save and restore properly
- [ ] **Progress tracking**: Sequential unlocking works for IA steps
- [ ] **Assessment functionality**: Imagination assessment with radar chart results
- [ ] **Video integration**: IA videos play with progress tracking
- [ ] **Admin capability**: IA data can be reset independently

## 🚨 CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION RULES

### DO NOT:
- Modify any existing AST functionality
- Use AST step IDs for IA content  
- Cross-reference AST and IA data
- Change existing database table structures

### DO:
- Use `appType: "ia"` for all IA progression data
- Prefix IA step IDs with `"ia-"` (e.g., `"ia-1-1"`)
- Follow exact same auto-save and progression patterns as AST
- Implement radar chart visualization for IA assessment results
- Use provided IA content files for workshop structure

## 📄 FILES TO REFERENCE

When implementing, use these files provided by the user:
1. **Video links file** - For IA workshop video sequence and URLs
2. **Content pages file** - For actual IA workshop content and structure  
3. **Assessment file** - For complete IA imagination assessment questions

## 🎯 IMPLEMENTATION READY

This document provides the complete specification for implementing the Imaginal Agility workshop. The implementation should replicate AST's robust progression system while maintaining complete independence and using IA-specific content and assessment structure.

## 🎨 BRANDING REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL

### ✅ **CORRECT BRANDING:**
- **Workshop Name**: "Imaginal Agility Workshop Course" (throughout all content)
- **App Header Only**: Heliotrope Imaginal logo appears only in main app header bar
- **Workshop Headers**: All section headers show "Imaginal Agility Workshop Course > [Section Name]"
- **Complete Separation**: No AST (AllStarTeams) branding anywhere in IA workshop

### ❌ **INCORRECT - DO NOT USE:**
- "Heliotrope Imaginal Workshop" 
- "Hi Heliotrope Imaginal" in workshop content
- Any AST/AllStarTeams logos or references
- Additional Heliotrope Imaginal logos beyond app header
