Looking at your codebase, you have multiple navigation hooks that serve different purposes and represent different stages of development:

Current Navigation Hooks:
use-simple-navigation.ts - Legacy hook with complex video progress tracking and dual-threshold system (5% for next button, 90% for completion)

use-navigation-progress.ts - Complex hook with assessment-based progression logic and automatic step completion based on database assessments

use-navigation-progress-clean.ts - Simplified version with feature flags to toggle between simplified/complex modes

use-navigation-progress-simplified.ts - Current active hook using simplified linear progression mode

What Each Hook Does:
use-simple-navigation.ts
Purpose: Original complex system with video progress thresholds
Features: Dual video tracking (max progress + current position), auto-completion at 90%, database sync
Status: Legacy, not actively used
use-navigation-progress.ts
Purpose: Assessment-driven progression with complex unlocking logic
Features: Recalculates progress based on user assessments, auto-completes steps when assessments exist
Status: Complex system, replaced by simplified approach
use-navigation-progress-clean.ts
Purpose: Cleaner version with feature flag system
Features: Can toggle between simplified/complex modes, maintains dual tracking for future restoration
Status: Transitional hook
use-navigation-progress-simplified.ts
Purpose: Currently active - Simple linear progression
Features:
Linear step unlocking (each completed step unlocks the next)
Video progress tracked but not used for unlocking
Assessment validation still required for assessment steps
Simplified database sync with debouncing
Status: Active in production
Why Multiple Hooks Exist:
The multiple hooks represent an evolution from a complex video-threshold and assessment-driven system to a simplified linear progression system. The simplified system was implemented to reduce complexity while maintaining the ability to restore advanced features later through feature flags.

The current active hook (use-navigation-progress-simplified.ts) focuses on user-controlled progression rather than automatic unlocking based on video watch percentages or assessment completion.
