# Complete Replit Agent Implementation Prompt: Interactive Discernment Training System

## 🎯 **IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW**
Create a complete interactive discernment training system with two components:
1. **Modal Exercise System** integrated into the Imaginal Agility workshop
2. **Standalone Practice Page** accessible without login at `/discernmentpractice`

## 📋 **IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**

### **Step 1: Update ia-6-1 Discernment Guide Step**

Add navigation buttons to the ia-6-1 step component:

```typescript
// Add to existing ia-6-1 component
import { useState } from 'react';
import DiscernmentExerciseModal from './DiscernmentExerciseModal';

// Add state management
const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);

// Add button handlers
const handlePracticeClick = () => setIsModalOpen(true);
const handleModalClose = () => setIsModalOpen(false);
const handleNextStep = () => {
  // Navigate to ia-7-1 Neuroscience step using existing navigation
};

// Add to JSX after existing content
<div className="navigation-buttons">
  <button 
    className="ia-secondary-btn" 
    onClick={handlePracticeClick}
  >
    Reality Discernment Practice
  </button>
  
  <button 
    className="ia-primary-btn" 
    onClick={handleNextStep}
  >
    Next: Neuroscience
  </button>
</div>

<DiscernmentExerciseModal 
  isOpen={isModalOpen} 
  onClose={handleModalClose} 
/>
```

### **Step 2: Create Modal Exercise System**

**File**: `client/src/components/imaginal-agility/DiscernmentExerciseModal.tsx`

```typescript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import './DiscernmentExercise.css';

interface ExerciseProps {
  isOpen: boolean;
  onClose: () => void;
}

const DiscernmentExerciseModal: React.FC<ExerciseProps> = ({ isOpen, onClose }) => {
  // Exercise data and state management
  const [currentExercise, setCurrentExercise] = useState(1);
  const [currentScenario, setCurrentScenario] = useState(0);
  const [userAnswers, setUserAnswers] = useState({});
  const [exerciseComplete, setExerciseComplete] = useState(false);

    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
  
  .exercise-content {
    padding: 20px;
  }
}
```

### **Step 6: Add Route Configuration**

**File**: Update your routing configuration to include:

```typescript
// Add to your route configuration
{
  path: '/discernmentpractice',
  element: <DiscernmentPractice />,
  // No authentication required - publicly accessible
}
```

## 🎯 **IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS**

### **Component Architecture:**
```
client/src/components/imaginal-agility/
├── DiscernmentExerciseModal.tsx (modal system)
├── DiscernmentExercise.css (modal styles)

client/src/pages/
├── DiscernmentPractice.tsx (standalone page)
├── DiscernmentPractice.css (standalone styles)
```

### **Integration Points:**
1. **ia-6-1 Step**: Add modal launcher and "Next: Neuroscience" button
2. **Navigation**: Ensure proper routing to ia-7-1 step
3. **Route**: Add `/discernmentpractice` route without authentication
4. **Styling**: Maintain IA purple branding throughout

### **Key Features:**
- **3 Complete Exercises** with workplace-focused content
- **Real stock photos** from Unsplash for visual challenges
- **Progressive advancement** through scenarios and exercises
- **No database persistence** - exercises reset on close
- **Randomized content** in standalone version
- **Mobile responsive** design throughout
- **Professional educational** quality and presentation

## ✅ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Modal System:**
- [ ] ia-6-1 has "Next: Neuroscience" button working
- [ ] "Reality Discernment Practice" button launches modal
- [ ] All 3 exercises progress correctly through scenarios
- [ ] Modal closes and returns to workshop properly

### **Standalone Page:**
- [ ] Accessible at `/discernmentpractice` without login
- [ ] Professional landing page with clear value proposition
- [ ] Randomized scenarios generate fresh content each session
- [ ] "Practice Again" button provides new randomized content

### **Technical Quality:**
- [ ] No conflicts with existing IA components
- [ ] Consistent IA branding throughout both implementations
- [ ] Mobile responsive on all devices
- [ ] Fast loading with proper error handling for stock photos

**This comprehensive implementation provides both the workshop integration and standalone practice capabilities with professional-quality content for knowledge workers.**

## 🚀 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Copy this markdown file** and save it as `discernment-implementation.md`
2. **Provide to Replit Agent** for implementation
3. **Test both modal and standalone** functionality
4. **Verify all features work** as specified
5. **Deploy and share** the standalone practice page

The complete code for both implementations is included above - ready for immediate deployment!
