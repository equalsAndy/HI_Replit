User Database System with Role-Based Access
Create a web application with a user management system that supports three distinct user roles and profile management.
Integration Requirements
Workshop App Integration

Critical: This user database must integrate with the existing "allstarteams workshop app"
Star Card Display: Participant profile data (name, job title, company, profile picture) should be displayed on their "star cards" throughout the allstarteams workshop app
The user database should provide an API or data connection that the workshop app can access to pull participant profile information
Ensure profile pictures, job titles, and company information appear consistently on star cards wherever they show up in the workshop interface

Core Requirements
User Roles

Admin - Full system access, can create other admins and facilitators, view all data, and delete any participant data
Facilitator - Can create participant accounts (up to 10), manage their own cohorts, edit participant profile data, delete their own participants' data
Participant - Can manage their own profile

Initial System Setup

First Admin Account: Brad Topliff (brad@selfactual.ai) should be created as the initial system administrator
Admins can create additional admin accounts
Facilitators receive username and password credentials created by admins

Key Features
1. Account Creation & Management System

Admins can create facilitator accounts with username and password
Facilitators can create participant accounts (up to 10 per facilitator)
Participants are automatically assigned to the facilitator who created them
Required fields for participant creation: Name and Email address
Optional: Assign participants to named cohorts for grouping
System automatically generates unique 8-character access codes for each participant
Facilitators can regenerate access codes if participants lose them
Display generated codes on screen for facilitators to manually share with participants
Facilitator Deactivation: When facilitators are deactivated, keep them in system; admins can replace them while cohorts remain intact

2. Data Management & Deletion

Facilitators can delete their own participants' data with confirmation
Admins can delete any participant data with confirmation
Two deletion options:

Clear Profile Data: Removes profile information but keeps account active
Delete Account: Completely removes participant account and all data


Multi-step confirmation process:

Initial delete button click
Confirmation modal with participant details
Type confirmation text or check multiple boxes
Final "Delete" button


Deletion logs for audit trail (who deleted what and when)
Participants use their unique code to first access the system

3. Participant Access & Profile Setup

Participants use their unique code to first access the system
On first login, participants must create their profile:

Edit/confirm their name and email address
Add job title (optional field)
Add company name (optional field)
Upload profile picture (optional, support common image formats, 2MB max file size)


After initial setup, participants can return anytime to edit their profile
Facilitators can also edit participant profile data for their own participants

4. Database Schema
Create tables for:

Users (id, name, email, role, unique_code, created_by_facilitator_id, is_active, created_at, updated_at)
Facilitators (id, user_id, max_participants, is_active, deactivated_at)
Cohorts (id, name, facilitator_id, created_at)
Participants (id, user_id, facilitator_id, cohort_id, profile_completed, profile_completion_percentage)
Profiles (user_id, job_title, company, profile_picture_url, completed_at)
Deletion_logs (id, deleted_by_user_id, deleted_participant_id, deletion_type, participant_name, deletion_reason, deleted_at)
Sessions/Authentication (with 3-hour timeout)

5. User Interface Requirements

Login page: Accept unique codes for participants, standard login for admin/facilitator
Admin dashboard:

Create new admin accounts
Create and manage facilitator accounts (activate/deactivate)
View all facilitators and their participant counts
Access all participant data across facilitators
Delete any participant data with confirmation process
System-wide analytics and completion tracking


Facilitator dashboard:

Create new participant accounts (up to 10)
Create and manage cohorts
View only their own participants grouped by cohort
Profile completion progress tracking with percentage indicators
Real-time completion status display for each participant
Copy/display access codes for sharing with participants
Regenerate access codes for participants
Edit participant profile data
Delete their own participants' data with confirmation process


Participant profile page:

Clean, user-friendly form for profile information
Image upload with preview
Save/update functionality


Navigation: Role-appropriate menu system
Deletion Confirmation System:

Multi-step confirmation modal
Display participant details before deletion
Require typing "DELETE" or participant name to confirm
Clear distinction between "Clear Profile" and "Delete Account"
Optional deletion reason field
Cannot be undone warning



6. Technical Specifications

Use a modern web framework (React, Vue, or vanilla HTML/CSS/JS)
Implement secure file upload for profile pictures (2MB max file size)
Include form validation and error handling
Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
Use SQLite or PostgreSQL for the database
Implement basic security measures (input sanitization, file type validation)
Password Requirements: Standard security (min 8 characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character)
Session Management: 3-hour automatic timeout for security
Data isolation: Facilitators can only access their own participants and cohorts
Role-based access control throughout the application
API Integration: Provide REST API endpoints for the allstarteams workshop app to access participant profile data
Star Card Data: API should return participant name, job title, company, and profile picture URL for workshop integration

7. Access Code System

Generate cryptographically secure, unique 8-character codes
Codes should be easy to type (avoid ambiguous characters like 0/O, 1/l)
One-time use: code becomes invalid after first successful login
Include code expiration (optional: 30-day expiry)

User Flows
Admin Flow:

Login to dashboard (initial admin: Brad Topliff - brad@selfactual.ai)
Create additional admin accounts and facilitator accounts (username/password)
Manage facilitator activation/deactivation status
View system-wide participant data and analytics
Access all facilitator and participant information
Delete any participant data using confirmation process

Facilitator Flow:

Login with username and password (3-hour session timeout)
Create cohorts (optional grouping for participants)
Click "Add Participant"
Enter participant name and email
Optionally assign to a cohort
System generates and displays unique code
Manually share code with participant (via email, message, etc.)
View their own participants organized by cohort with completion progress
Monitor real-time profile completion status for their participants
Edit participant profile data as needed
Regenerate access codes if participants lose them
Delete their own participants' data using confirmation process

Participant Flow:

Receive unique access code from facilitator
Visit site and enter code
Complete profile setup form
Upload profile picture (optional)
Save profile and access personal dashboard

Data Deletion Flow (Admin/Facilitator):

Navigate to participant list
Click delete button next to participant

Future Features (For Later Implementation)

Search and filter functionality for participant lists
Bulk participant import via CSV with cohort assignment
Data export functionality (participant data by cohort or facilitator)
Cohort management: rename, delete, move participants between cohorts
Advanced facilitator analytics: completion rates, cohort comparisons
Backup and data export functionality for the entire system
Enhanced integration capabilities with workshop app (real-time updates, webhooks)
Advanced reporting and analytics beyond basic completion tracking
Bulk operations (bulk delete, bulk cohort assignment)
System notifications when participants complete profiles

Please create a fully functional application with clean, professional styling and include sample data for testing.
IMPORTANT INTEGRATION NOTE: This user database system must integrate with the existing "allstarteams workshop app" to display participant profile data on star cards. Ensure the database provides appropriate API endpoints or data connections for the workshop app to access participant profile information (name, job title, company, profile picture) and display it consistently on star cards throughout the workshop interface.
