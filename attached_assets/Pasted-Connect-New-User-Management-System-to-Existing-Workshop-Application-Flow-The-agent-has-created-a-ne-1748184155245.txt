Connect New User Management System to Existing Workshop Application Flow

The agent has created a new user management system, but it's not properly integrated with our existing workshop application. Our real application flow is:

Landing Page: client/src/pages/landing.tsx - Users choose between AllStarTeams or Imaginal Agility
Authentication: client/src/pages/auth-page.tsx - User login/registration
Workshop Pages:
client/src/pages/allstarteams.tsx - AllStarTeams workshop
client/src/pages/imaginal-agility.tsx - Imaginal Agility workshop
Current Problem: The new user management appears to be using client/src/pages/home.tsx as an alternate landing page, bypassing our established flow.

Required Integration Tasks:

Route Integration: Update the routing system to ensure the new user management works with our existing pages (landing.tsx → auth-page.tsx → workshop pages)

Authentication Flow: Connect the new user management authentication with our existing auth system that handles the workshop selection and user routing

Database Integration: Ensure the new user management system uses the same user database/storage that our workshop pages (allstarteams.tsx, imaginal-agility.tsx) expect

Session Management: Make sure user sessions created by the new management system are compatible with how our workshop pages check for authenticated users

Navigation Consistency: Update any navigation or routing logic to maintain the proper flow: landing → auth → workshop selection → workshop content

Key Files to Review/Update:

Routing configuration
client/src/pages/landing.tsx (our real landing page)
client/src/pages/auth-page.tsx (our auth system)
client/src/pages/allstarteams.tsx and client/src/pages/imaginal-agility.tsx (workshop pages)
Any authentication middleware or context providers
User storage/database integration
Goal: Users should be able to seamlessly go from the new user management system through our established workshop application flow without any disconnects or authentication issues.

Please audit the current setup and make the necessary connections so the new user management system properly integrates with our existing workshop application pages.
