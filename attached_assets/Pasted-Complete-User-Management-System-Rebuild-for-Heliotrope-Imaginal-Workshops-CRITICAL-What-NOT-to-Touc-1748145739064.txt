Complete User Management System Rebuild for Heliotrope Imaginal Workshops
CRITICAL: What NOT to Touch
DO NOT ALTER:

Any workshop content, components, or functionality
Star card system (only ensure compatibility with new profile data)
Video content management
Workshop progress tracking logic
Any existing workshop-related components in client/src/components/
Assessment systems (starCards, flowAttributes database tables)
The 5 existing test users and test admin functionality - PRESERVE THESE

PRESERVE:

Current database tables: starCards, flowAttributes, sessions
Workshop video and content systems
Test user system and test admin access
All workshop-related routes and components

Step 1: Clean Removal of Current User Management
Remove only user management related code:

server/auth-routes.ts (rebuild completely)
server/admin-routes.ts (rebuild completely)
client/src/components/admin/* (rebuild completely)
User management UI components only
Keep database schema.ts but modify user-related tables only

Step 2: Enhanced Database Schema
Modify existing schema.ts to add:
typescript// Add to existing users table
users: {
  // existing fields...
  inviteCode: varchar('invite_code', { length: 12 }).unique(),
  codeUsed: boolean('code_used').default(false),
  organization: varchar('organization', { length: 30 }),
  jobTitle: varchar('job_title', { length: 30 }),
  profilePicture: text('profile_picture'), // URL or base64
  createdByFacilitator: integer('created_by_facilitator').references(() => users.id),
  // keep all existing fields
}

// Add pending invites tracking
pendingInvites: {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  inviteCode: varchar('invite_code', { length: 12 }).unique(),
  email: varchar('email', { length: 255 }),
  name: varchar('name', { length: 100 }),
  createdBy: integer('created_by').references(() => users.id),
  createdAt: timestamp('created_at').defaultNow(),
  expiresAt: timestamp('expires_at'),
  cohortId: integer('cohort_id').references(() => cohorts.id).nullable(),
}
Step 3: Code Generation System
Create 12-character invite codes:

Character set: ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789 (no confusing chars)
One-time use only
Expires when successfully used
Admins/facilitators can regenerate if needed

Step 4: Role-Based User Creation
Admin Permissions:

Create facilitators, admins, and participants
View/manage all users and cohorts
Reassign participants and cohorts between facilitators
Access all system functionality

Facilitator Permissions:

Create participants only
Create cohorts (auto-assigned as facilitator)
View/manage only their assigned participants and cohorts
Generated participants auto-assigned to them

Participant Permissions:

Standard user access to workshops
Can edit name, organization, job title, profile picture
Cannot edit email (admin/facilitator only)

Step 5: User Creation Workflow
For Admins/Facilitators:

Add user form with:

Name (required)
Email (required)
Role selection (admin: all roles, facilitator: participant only)
Cohort assignment (optional, dropdown of available cohorts)


System generates 12-character code
Display code to admin/facilitator to share with user
Track pending invites with status

For New Users (Code Entry):

Login page has "Have an invite code?" option
Code entry creates profile setup modal:

Pre-filled name and email (name editable, email read-only)
Username creation (follow rules below)
Password creation or generation
Organization (30 char limit)
Job Title (30 char limit)
Profile picture upload


Complete profile creation activates account and marks code as used

Step 6: Username Requirements

3-20 characters long
Letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens only
Must start with letter or number
No consecutive underscores/hyphens
Case-insensitive (stored lowercase)
Unique across system
Reserved words blocked: admin, system, test, support, help, api, root

Step 7: Password Requirements

Minimum 8 characters
At least one uppercase letter
At least one lowercase letter
At least one number
At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)
System can generate secure passwords meeting these rules

Step 8: New UI Components Needed
Admin Dashboard:

User management table with search/filter
Pending invites tracker with status
Cohort management with facilitator assignment
Role management tools
Bulk operations where appropriate

Facilitator Dashboard:

My participants view
My cohorts view
Create participant form
Create cohort form
Pending invites for my users

Profile Management:

User profile edit modal
Password change functionality
Profile picture upload/management

Invite Code Modal:

Clean, intuitive profile setup
Username availability checking
Password strength indicator
Profile picture preview

Step 9: Security & Validation

All password hashing with bcrypt (existing standard)
Server-side role validation on all operations
Input sanitization and validation
File upload validation for profile pictures
Rate limiting on invite code generation
Secure session management (maintain existing)

Step 10: Data Integration
Star Card Compatibility:
Ensure new profile data (name, organization, jobTitle, profilePicture) integrates smoothly with existing star card system.
Workshop Integration:

Maintain existing workshop progress tracking
Preserve user assessment data relationships
Keep all existing workshop functionality intact

Step 11: Cohort Management Enhancement

Facilitators auto-assigned to cohorts they create
Participants can be assigned during creation or later
Users don't require cohort membership
Admin reassignment capabilities
Clear cohort ownership tracking

Step 12: Pending Invites Dashboard
Show for admins/facilitators:

Pending codes with recipient info
Code generation date
Expiration status
Ability to regenerate codes
Workshop progress tracking for completed users

Step 13: User and Cohort Deletion
User Deletion Permissions:
Admins can delete:

Any participant, facilitator, or admin
Cannot delete themselves (require another admin)

Facilitators can delete:

Only participants assigned to them
Cannot delete other facilitators or admins
Cannot delete themselves

User Deletion Process:

Soft Delete Implementation:

Add deletedAt timestamp to users table
Mark user as deleted instead of hard delete
Preserve workshop progress and assessment data
Hide deleted users from normal views
Admin option to permanently delete after 30 days


Deletion Confirmation:

Two-step confirmation process
Show user's workshop progress and data that will be affected
Warning about data preservation/loss
Final confirmation with typed username


Data Handling:

Preserve star cards and assessment data (for analytics)
Maintain workshop progress records
Remove from active cohorts
Invalidate all sessions
Keep user ID for data integrity



Cohort Deletion Permissions:
Admins can delete:

Any cohort in the system
View all participants that will be affected

Facilitators can delete:

Only cohorts they created or are assigned to
View their participants that will be affected

Cohort Deletion Process:

Pre-deletion Check:

Show all participants in the cohort
Display workshop progress that might be affected
Option to reassign participants to another cohort
Option to remove participants from cohort without deletion


Deletion Options:

Delete cohort only (participants remain, just unassigned)
Delete cohort and reassign participants to another cohort
Warning if any participants will be left without cohorts


Confirmation Process:

Show impact summary
Require typed cohort name for confirmation
Final warning about participant reassignment



Bulk Operations:

Select multiple users for deletion
Bulk cohort reassignment before deletion
Batch operations with progress indicators
Comprehensive action logs

Safety Measures:

Action logging for all deletions
Email notifications to affected users (configurable)
Recovery options for soft deletes
Admin audit trail
Prevent deletion of users with critical system roles

UI Components:

Delete confirmation modals
Impact preview screens
Recovery interface for soft deletes
Audit log viewer for admins
Bulk selection interface

Implementation Priority:

Database schema updates (including soft delete fields)
Backend API routes (auth and admin)
Core user creation/invite system
Profile setup modal and code entry
Admin/facilitator dashboards
Enhanced cohort management
User and cohort deletion system with safety measures
Integration testing with existing workshop system

Success Criteria:

✅ Seamless invite code workflow
✅ Role-based permissions working correctly
✅ Safe user/cohort deletion with data preservation
✅ Star card integration maintained
✅ Workshop functionality unaffected
✅ Test users and admin preserved
✅ Clean, intuitive admin interface
✅ Secure authentication maintained
✅ Mobile-responsive design
✅ Comprehensive audit logging

Start with database schema updates and work systematically through each component. Ensure thorough testing at each step to verify workshop systems remain intact.
