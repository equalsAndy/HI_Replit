Video Management Enhancement Prompt
Objective: Enhance the existing video management system to improve admin workflow and content view integration with the following specific requirements:

Core Requirements:
Replace "Section" column with "Step ID" column

Remove the current "Section" column from the video table
Add a "Step ID" column that displays navigation step identifiers (e.g., "1-1", "2-3")
Update the table headers and data display accordingly
Auto-populate titles from navigation menu items

When a Step ID is entered, automatically populate the title field based on the existing navigationMenuItems object
This should work for both create and edit forms
Allow manual override of auto-populated titles
Video ID field enhancement

Ensure the editableId field is prominently displayed and easily editable
This field should be the primary identifier used by content views to match videos
Auto-extract video IDs from YouTube URLs but allow manual editing
Add autoplay functionality

Add an autoplay boolean field to the database schema
Include autoplay checkbox in both create and edit forms
When autoplay is enabled, modify the embed URL to include ?autoplay=1 parameter
Enhanced video preview and embed code

In the edit modal, display a live video preview using the current URL
Show the exact embed code that will be used in content views below the preview
Include the autoplay parameter in the embed code when enabled
The embed code should be read-only (for display purposes only)
Database schema modifications

Add stepId field (varchar, nullable) for navigation step identifiers
Add autoplay field (boolean, default false) for autoplay functionality
Ensure proper indexing and constraints
Technical Implementation Details:
Frontend: Update the VideoManagement component to handle the new fields and auto-population logic
Backend: Modify the video routes and schema to support the new fields
Database: Add the new columns with appropriate migrations
Integration: Ensure content views can properly consume videos using the editableId field
User Experience Requirements:
Maintain the current table layout but swap Section for Step ID
Keep all existing functionality (add, edit, delete, preview, copy iframe)
Auto-populate titles should happen in real-time as Step ID is typed
Video preview should update immediately when URL changes
Clear visual distinction between auto-populated and manually entered titles
Navigation Menu Integration:
Use the existing navigationMenuItems structure to auto-populate titles:

allstarteams workshop sections and their step mappings
imaginal-agility workshop sections and their step mappings
Support for future workshop types through the same structure
The agent should focus on enhancing the existing video management system without breaking current functionality, ensuring seamless integration with the content view system that relies on video IDs for matching.
