# Replit Prompt: Imaginal Agility Workshop Assessment App

## Project Overview
Create a comprehensive web application for the **Imaginal Agility Workshop** that implements the HI Imagination Self-Assessment V3. This replaces the previous 5Cs workshop and measures five foundational human capacities essential for adaptive intelligence in the AI era.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Assessment Structure
Build a multi-step assessment measuring these five capacities:

**IMAGINATION** (7 sub-dimensions):
- Generative Fluency (2 questions)
- Temporal Flexibility (2 questions) 
- Perspectival Agility (2 questions)
- Boundary Permeability (2 questions)
- Ambiguity Tolerance (2 questions)
- Embodied Translation (2 questions)
- Playful Wonder/Transcendence (1 question)

**CURIOSITY** (1 sub-dimension):
- Exploration Drive (2 questions)

**EMPATHY** (1 sub-dimension):
- Emotional Insight (2 questions)

**CREATIVITY** (1 sub-dimension):
- Applied Creativity (2 questions)

**COURAGE** (1 sub-dimension):
- Principled Action (2 questions)

### 2. Question Content (Use these exact questions)

**IMAGINATION - Generative Fluency:**
- "I can easily come up with multiple, unconventional ideas."
- "I often generate new ideas in my daily life."

**IMAGINATION - Temporal Flexibility:**
- "I can vividly imagine different possible futures or pasts."
- "I often reflect on alternative outcomes before making decisions."

**IMAGINATION - Perspectival Agility:**
- "I can imagine experiences beyond my current reality."
- "I frequently consider other people's viewpoints in discussions."

**IMAGINATION - Boundary Permeability:**
- "I'm comfortable blending ideas from different domains (e.g., science and art)."
- "I actively seek inspiration from outside my usual field."

**IMAGINATION - Ambiguity Tolerance:**
- "I can explore complex ideas without needing quick answers."
- "I feel comfortable with uncertainty when solving problems."

**IMAGINATION - Embodied Translation:**
- "I can turn abstract ideas into tangible actions or prototypes."
- "I take steps to bring my ideas to life."

**IMAGINATION - Playful Wonder:**
- "I allow myself to daydream, imagine, or wonderâ€”even if it feels unproductive."

**CURIOSITY - Exploration Drive:**
- "I frequently seek out new experiences or knowledge."
- "I enjoy exploring unfamiliar topics."

**EMPATHY - Emotional Insight:**
- "I'm good at understanding how others feel."
- "I try to see situations through others' eyes."

**CREATIVITY - Applied Creativity:**
- "I engage regularly in creative activities (e.g., art, writing, design)."
- "I often come up with novel solutions to everyday challenges."

**COURAGE - Principled Action:**
- "I take risks to pursue ideas or values I believe in."
- "I stand up for what I believe, even when it's unpopular."

### 3. User Interface Requirements

**Assessment Flow:**
- Welcome page explaining the 5 capacities and 10-15 minute time commitment
- Progressive question presentation (one question per screen or grouped by dimension)
- 5-point Likert scale: 1=Strongly Disagree, 2=Disagree, 3=Neutral, 4=Agree, 5=Strongly Agree
- Progress indicator showing completion status
- Ability to go back and revise answers

**Visual Design:**
- Clean, modern interface with intuitive navigation
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Use colors that reflect creativity and imagination (consider gradients, vibrant but professional palette)
- Clear typography that's easy to read

### 4. Results & Visualization

**Radar Chart Generation:**
- Calculate average scores for each of the 5 main capacities
- Create interactive radar/spider chart with 5 axes
- Allow users to save/download their chart
- Show numerical scores alongside visual representation

**Results Dashboard:**
- Display individual capacity scores
- Highlight strongest and development areas
- Include brief interpretive text for each capacity
- Show overall imagination profile summary

### 5. Reflection Component

**Optional Reflection Prompts:** (Include these exact prompts)
- "Which recent moment best reflects your courage in action?"
- "How has your imagination helped you navigate a recent challenge?"
- "Where do you feel most curious in your current life or work?"
- "What situation recently expanded your empathy or understanding of others?"
- "When did creativity last help you solve a difficult problem?"

**Implementation:**
- Make reflection prompts optional but encouraged
- Provide text areas for written responses
- Allow users to save responses for future reference

### 6. Data Management

**Storage Requirements:**
- Store assessment responses securely
- Enable users to retake assessment for growth tracking
- Compare results over time (suggest 3-6 month intervals)
- Export functionality for personal records

**Privacy:**
- No personal data required beyond basic demographics (optional)
- Clear privacy policy about data usage
- Option to use anonymously

### 7. Technical Specifications

**Frontend:**
- Use React or vanilla JavaScript
- Implement Chart.js or D3.js for radar chart visualization
- Responsive CSS framework (Bootstrap or Tailwind)
- Local storage for session management

**Backend:**
- Simple Node.js/Express server
- SQLite or PostgreSQL database for data persistence
- REST API for assessment submission and retrieval

**Features to Include:**
- Print-friendly results page
- Email results functionality
- Social sharing options (optional)
- Admin dashboard for aggregate insights (if needed)

### 8. Additional Features

**Growth Tracking:**
- Comparison view showing assessment results over time
- Progress indicators and improvement suggestions
- Goal-setting functionality based on results

**Team Integration:**
- Option to share results with team members
- Aggregate team radar charts
- Team discussion prompts based on collective results
