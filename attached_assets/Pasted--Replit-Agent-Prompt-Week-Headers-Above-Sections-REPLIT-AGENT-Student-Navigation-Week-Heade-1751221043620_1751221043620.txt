## Implementation Requirements
1. **Role Detection**: Check if `currentApp?.user?.role === 'student'` OR `currentApp?.user?.role === 'facilitator'`
2. **Week Headers**: Add separate navigation sections with just "WEEK 1:", "WEEK 2:", etc. as headers
3. **Section Splitting**: Split "Visualize your Potential" into Part 1 (Week 3) and Part 2 (Week 4)
4. **Preserve All Logic**: Keep exact same step IDs, paths, and progression logic
5. **Conditional Structure**: Other user types see original navigation unchanged

## File to Modify
`client/src/components/navigation/Navigation.tsx` - Replace the `journeySections` array with conditional logic based on user role.

## Critical Requirements
- Preserve ALL existing step IDs and paths
- Maintain ALL progression/unlocking logic
- Only students and facilitators see week structure
- "WEEK #:" as separate header sections above content sections
- Split visualization section while keeping same steps

## Expected Result
Students/facilitators see week-based structure with clear week headers, others see original structure.
This prompt will properly implement the week headers as separate sections above the content, which is what the navigation system needs to render them correctly.
