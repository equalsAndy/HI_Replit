Based on the code, here are the key rules for a Star Card:

There is one star card throughout the app. The data drives what appears but it is consistent from user-home, foundation, and find-your-flow. The star card should always look the same througout the app.

These are the graphics involved:

Core Components:
User Profile: Name, Title, Organization, and optional Avatar/Image
Apex Strength section with "Imagination" text
4 Quadrants showing strengths: Thinking, Acting, Feeling, Planning
4 Flow squares positioned around the quadrants
Connecting arrows between components

Quadrant Colors:
Thinking: Green (rgb(1, 162, 82))
Acting: Red (rgb(241, 64, 64))
Feeling: Blue (rgb(22, 126, 253))
Planning: Yellow (rgb(255, 203, 47))
Default/Empty: Gray (rgb(229, 231, 235))

Score Display:
Quadrant scores are displayed as percentages
Percentages are calculated by: (individual score / total score) Ã— 100
Scores must be greater than 0 to be considered valid
Card shows nothing but an empty square when scores are not available

Flow Attributes:
4 flow squares around the main quadrants
Each flow square can have text and a color
Shows "Awaiting data" when flow attributes are not set

Validation Rules:
Strengths Assessment must be completed (scores > 0)
Card is marked as pending until assessment is complete
Flow data is optional but enhances the card
Both assessment completion and flow data are required for downloading

Star card on first login.
Empty. Nothing but the default box in the quadrant and flow areas.
The Strengths quadrant has position 1 in the upper right, 2 in lower right, 3 in lower left and 4 in upper left
Flow follows with Flow 1 in upper right and so on.
All of those are default/empty with a gray box and no text.

Once the strengths assessment is complete the star card shows the strengths from position 1 (the biggest percentage) then clockwise with the next largest and so on. It shows the strength and the percentage below it.

The StarCard appears in multiple places:

/client/src/components/starcard/StarCard.tsx (main component)
/client/src/components/starcard/EditableStarCard.tsx (wrapper with image upload)
Used in pages:
user-home.tsx
foundations.tsx
report.tsx
The StarCard is used to display user assessment results with:

Profile information (name, title, organization)
Quadrant scores (thinking, acting, feeling, planning)
Flow attributes
Downloadable image functionality
Cloud graphic with "Imagination" as apex strength

Pending States:
pending: true - Assessment is in progress or not completed
pending: false - Assessment is completed

Completion States:
hasCompletedAssessment: true - Strength Scores exist and pending is false
hasCompletedAssessment: false - No scores or pending is true

Data States:
hasStarCardData: true - Assessment completed and has non-zero scores
hasStarCardData: false - Assessment incomplete or all scores are zero

Flow States:
hasFlowData: true - Flow attributes exist and have text
hasFlowData: false - No flow attributes or empty text

The state checks are primarily handled in the StarCard component with these key conditions:

const hasCompletedAssessment = scores > 0 && pending !== true;
const hasStarCardData = hasCompletedAssessment && scores > 0;
const hasFlowData = flowAttributes?.length > 0 && flowAttributes.every(attr => attr.text);
