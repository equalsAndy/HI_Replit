# REPLIT ASSISTANT: Test User System Enhancement - DISCOVERY ONLY

## üö® CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
**DO NOT MODIFY ANY FILES** - This is a discovery and analysis phase only.
**DO NOT FIX OR CHANGE ANYTHING** unless explicitly requested.
**ONLY ANALYZE AND REPORT** what currently exists.

## üéØ OBJECTIVE
Analyze the current test user system across both AST and IA workshops to understand existing implementation before any enhancements. Provide comprehensive documentation of what exists without making any changes.

## üìã DISCOVERY AND ANALYSIS ONLY - NO MODIFICATIONS

### **‚ö†Ô∏è STRICT CONSTRAINTS:**
- ‚ùå **DO NOT modify, fix, or change any files**
- ‚ùå **DO NOT implement any new features**
- ‚ùå **DO NOT correct any issues you find**
- ‚úÖ **ONLY analyze and document current state**
- ‚úÖ **ONLY run discovery commands and report findings**
- ‚úÖ **ASK for explicit permission before any modifications**

## üìã DISCOVERY PHASE REQUIREMENTS

### **1. Current Test User Implementation Analysis**
```bash
# Search for existing test user patterns
grep -r "testUser\|isTestUser\|test_user\|TestUser" client/src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" -n
grep -r "addTestData\|demo.*data\|test.*data" client/src/ --include="*.tsx" --include="*.ts" -n

# Find assessment components
find client/src -name "*assessment*" -type f
find client/src -name "*Assessment*" -type f

# Find reflection components  
find client/src -name "*reflection*" -type f
find client/src -name "*Reflection*" -type f
```

### **2. Authentication & User Context Analysis**
```bash
# Locate user authentication/context files
find client/src -name "*auth*" -type f
find client/src -name "*user*" -type f  
find client/src -name "*context*" -type f

# Check for existing test user declaration system
grep -r "test.*user\|user.*test" server/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" -n
```

### **3. Current Implementation Inventory**
Please identify and document:

**Test User Detection:**
- [ ] How is a user marked as test user? (database field, context, etc.)
- [ ] Where is test user status checked in the app?
- [ ] Current authentication/user context structure

**Existing Test Data Features:**
- [ ] List all components with "add test data" buttons
- [ ] Document current test data patterns (what data is added)
- [ ] Identify inconsistencies in implementation

**Assessment & Reflection Components:**
- [ ] All assessment components in AST workshop
- [ ] All assessment components in IA workshop  
- [ ] All reflection components in both workshops
- [ ] Components that currently lack test data features

### **3. Discovery Report Format**
Please provide findings in this structured format:

**CURRENT TEST USER IMPLEMENTATION:**
- Test user detection method: [how is test user status determined]
- Test user storage: [where is this status stored/retrieved]  
- Authentication integration: [how it connects to auth system]

**EXISTING TEST DATA FEATURES:**
- Components with test buttons: [list all components that have test features]
- Test button implementations: [describe current patterns]
- Test data patterns: [what type of data is added]
- Inconsistencies found: [differences in implementation]

**COMPONENTS ANALYSIS:**
- Assessment components found: [list all assessment components]
- Reflection components found: [list all reflection components]
- Components with test features: [which ones already have test functionality]
- Components lacking test features: [which ones need test functionality added]

**SECURITY ANALYSIS:**
- Current protection mechanisms: [how are test features protected]
- Potential security gaps: [areas that need improvement]
- Non-test user safeguards: [what prevents non-test access]

**ENHANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES:**
- Standardization needs: [areas lacking consistency]
- Missing functionality: [components that should have test features]
- Improvement recommendations: [suggestions for enhancement]

## üö´ REMINDER: ANALYSIS ONLY
**This prompt is for discovery and documentation only. Do not implement any changes, fixes, or enhancements. Wait for explicit instruction to proceed with modifications.**
