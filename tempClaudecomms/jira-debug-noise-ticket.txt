====================================
JIRA TICKET - EXCESSIVE DEBUG LOGGING
Date: 2025-07-25
====================================

ISSUE TYPE: Bug
PROJECT: KAN (Development tasks)
PRIORITY: Medium
SUMMARY: Excessive console debug logging causing performance issues on page reload

DESCRIPTION:
The workshop interface is generating excessive debug console output on every page reload, causing:
- Poor user experience with noisy console
- Potential performance degradation
- Difficult debugging of real issues

CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
- Every page reload generates 200+ debug messages
- Multiple duplicate debug messages for same operations
- Debug messages include:
  * Step completion checks for ALL steps (1-1 through 6-1)
  * Step accessibility checks for ALL steps  
  * Navigation debug for ALL steps
  * Video player debug messages (repeated)
  * User home navigation debug (repeated)
  * AllStarTeams interface debug (repeated)
  * Route detection debug (repeated)

SPECIFIC DEBUG PATTERNS FOUND:
```
üîç Step X-X completion check: false completedSteps: []
üîì Step accessibility check: X-X - unlocked: false, available steps: 1-1
üìä UserHomeNavigation Debug: {completedSteps: Array(0)...}
üéØ AllStarTeams Interface Debug: {userData: ...}
üîç Route Detection Debug: ...
üé• useVideoByStepId: Looking for stepId "1-1"...  
üé¨ VideoPlayer Debug - Step: 1-1...
```

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- Minimal console output in production
- Debug messages only when needed for troubleshooting
- Performance-optimized component rendering

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
1. Reduce console debug messages by 90%+
2. Keep only essential error logging in production
3. Move detailed debug to development mode only
4. Optimize component re-rendering to prevent duplicate checks

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Debug messages originate from multiple components (NavBar, VideoPlayer, UserHomeNavigation, etc.)
- Many messages are duplicated due to component re-renders
- Pattern suggests unnecessary re-computation of step accessibility
- Consider implementing debug flag feature switch

ENVIRONMENT: Staging (app2.heliotropeimaginal.com)
BROWSER: All browsers affected
STEPS TO REPRODUCE:
1. Navigate to /allstarteams
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Reload page
4. Observe 200+ debug messages
