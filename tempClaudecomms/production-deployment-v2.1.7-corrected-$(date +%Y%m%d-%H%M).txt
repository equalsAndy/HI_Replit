# Production Deployment v2.1.7 CORRECTED
# Date: $(date +%Y-%m-%d\ %H:%M:%S)

## üö® ISSUE RESOLUTION:
- Previous v2.1.7 deployment (version 92) FAILED and rolled back
- Problem: Image compatibility issues with production environment
- Solution: Rebuilt image with explicit AMD64 platform and proper tag

## ‚úÖ CORRECTED DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
1. Clean checkout of v2.1.7 git tag
2. Docker build with --platform linux/amd64 flag
3. Tagged as v2.1.7-fixed for distinction
4. Pushed to ECR: 962000089613.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/hi-replit-app:v2.1.7-fixed
5. Deployed as version 93 to Lightsail

## üîÑ CURRENT STATUS:
- Service state: DEPLOYING
- Current active version: 90 (old staging image - still serving traffic)
- Next deployment: Version 93 (v2.1.7-fixed) - ACTIVATING
- Deployment initiated: 2025-07-28T08:42:48-07:00

## üéØ KEY FIXES IN THIS CORRECTED BUILD:
- Platform compatibility: Built with --platform linux/amd64
- Image validation: Proper AMD64 architecture for production
- Clean build: From clean v2.1.7 git tag state
- Distinct tagging: v2.1.7-fixed to differentiate from failed attempt

## üåê PRODUCTION URLS (will be active once deployment completes):
- Custom domain: https://app2.heliotropeimaginal.com/
- Lightsail URL: https://hi-replit-v2.tqr7xha9v8ynw.us-west-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com/

## üìä MONITORING COMMANDS:
# Check deployment progress
aws lightsail get-container-services --region us-west-2 --service-name hi-replit-v2 | jq '.containerServices[0] | {state: .state, currentVersion: .currentDeployment.version, nextVersion: .nextDeployment.version}'

# Test health endpoint (after deployment)
curl https://app2.heliotropeimaginal.com/health

## üïê EXPECTED COMPLETION:
Lightsail deployments typically take 5-15 minutes. Success indicators:
- Service state: "RUNNING"
- Current version: 93
- Current image: contains "v2.1.7-fixed"
- Next deployment: null

## üîç FEATURES IN v2.1.7:
- IA navigation improvements (expand sections 1-4, collapse 5-7)
- Remove lock icons from current IA steps
- Fix infinite loop in useTestUser hook
- Semantic versioning system
- Enhanced feature flag system
- General platform stability improvements

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTES:
- AI/Talia features remain development-only (not in production)
- This deployment contains only stable workshop platform features
- Version 93 uses corrected AMD64-compatible image
- Previous version 92 failure has been resolved

## ‚úÖ POST-DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION:
Once deployment completes, verify:
1. https://app2.heliotropeimaginal.com/ returns 200 OK
2. IA navigation behavior matches v2.1.7 specifications
3. User login/registration flows work correctly
4. No console errors or broken functionality
5. Health endpoint responds properly

## üîÑ ROLLBACK PLAN (if needed):
If this deployment also fails, rollback is automatic to version 90.
For manual rollback, redeploy previous known-good image.
