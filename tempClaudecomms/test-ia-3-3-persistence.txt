# Test IA_3_3 Data Persistence - 2025-07-26

## ISSUES FOUND AND FIXED:

1. **handleSave function was broken** - was using old `setSaving` instead of persistence hook
2. **Missing saveNow from hook** - wasn't destructuring `saveNow` from useWorkshopStepData
3. **Not actually saving data** - handleSave was only simulating save, not calling real save

## FIXES APPLIED:

1. Updated handleSave to use `await saveNow()` from persistence hook
2. Added `saveNow` to destructured hook return values
3. Added proper error handling for save failures

## TO TEST THE FIX:

1. Go to IA workshop step 3-3 (Visualizing Your Potential)
2. Select an image from the gallery OR upload an image
3. Fill in the reflection textarea 
4. Fill in the image title field
5. Click "Continue to From Insight to Intention" button

**Expected Results:**
- Button should work and navigate to step 3-4
- Data should persist if you go back to step 3-3
- Data should appear in admin export for the user

## VERIFICATION COMMANDS:

Check if data is being saved:
```sql
SELECT user_id, step_id, data, created_at 
FROM workshop_step_data 
WHERE workshop_type = 'ia' AND step_id = 'ia-3-3' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

Check all IA data for a user:
```sql
SELECT step_id, data->>'reflection' as reflection, data->>'imageTitle' as title
FROM workshop_step_data 
WHERE workshop_type = 'ia' AND user_id = [USER_ID]
ORDER BY step_id;
```

## REMAINING COMPONENTS TO FIX:

These IA components still need the same treatment:
- IA_4_4_Content.tsx (needs full persistence hook implementation)
- IA_4_6_Content.tsx (needs full persistence hook implementation)

The build completed successfully, so the fixes should be active now.
