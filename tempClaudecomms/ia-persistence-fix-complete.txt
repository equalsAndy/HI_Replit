# IA Data Persistence - Final Fix Applied
# Date: 2025-07-26

## ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED

### The Bug
The `checkWorkshopLocked` middleware in `/server/routes/workshop-data-routes.ts` was looking for:
```javascript
const appType = req.body.appType || req.params.appType || 'ast';
```

But the API request sends:
```javascript
{
  "workshopType": "ia",  // ← This field name
  "stepId": "ia-3-4",
  "data": {...}
}
```

**Result**: All IA requests were being treated as 'ast' workshop type, causing middleware confusion and potential blocking.

### The Fix
Changed line 42 in workshop-data-routes.ts:
```javascript
// OLD:
const appType = req.body.appType || req.params.appType || 'ast';

// NEW:
const appType = req.body.workshopType || req.body.appType || req.params.appType || 'ast';
```

## ✅ DEBUGGING ADDED

Added comprehensive console logging to `useWorkshopStepData` hook:
- 🔍 Auto-save trigger logging
- 🔍 API request logging  
- 🔍 Response status logging
- ✅ Success confirmation logging
- ❌ Error detailed logging

## ✅ TESTING INSTRUCTIONS

### For You to Test:
1. **Open browser** and login as any user
2. **Navigate to IA workshop** (any step: ia-3-3, ia-3-4, ia-4-4, etc.)
3. **Open console** (F12 → Console tab)
4. **Enter data** in any form field
5. **Watch console** for debug messages:
   ```
   🔍 Auto-save check: {workshopType: "ia", stepId: "ia-3-4", hasContent: true}
   🔍 Triggering debounced save for: {workshopType: "ia", stepId: "ia-3-4"}
   🔍 Saving workshop data: {workshopType: "ia", stepId: "ia-3-4", dataToSave: {...}}
   🔍 Save response status: 200
   ✅ Save successful for: {workshopType: "ia", stepId: "ia-3-4"}
   ```

### Database Verification:
```sql
SELECT user_id, workshop_type, step_id, data, created_at 
FROM workshop_step_data 
WHERE workshop_type = 'ia' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Export Verification:
1. Login as admin
2. Export user data
3. Check for `workshopStepData.ia` section in JSON

## ✅ EXPECTED RESULTS

After this fix:
- ✅ IA data should auto-save as you type
- ✅ Data should persist between page refreshes  
- ✅ Data should appear in database
- ✅ Data should be included in exports
- ✅ Console will show detailed debugging info

## Files Modified
1. `server/routes/workshop-data-routes.ts` - Fixed middleware parameter bug
2. `client/src/hooks/useWorkshopStepData.ts` - Added debug logging

## Cleanup Needed Later
Remove debug console.logs from useWorkshopStepData hook after confirming fix works.

**This should now work exactly like the AST workshop data persistence!**
