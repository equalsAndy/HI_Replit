# Test Export Functionality with IA Workshop Data
# Date: 2025-07-26
# Issue: IA workshop step data was missing from user exports

## WHAT WAS FIXED:
1. Added workshopStepData import to export-service.ts
2. Updated ExportData interface to include workshopStepData field
3. Added code to fetch and organize workshop step data by type (AST/IA)
4. Updated export metadata to include workshop step counts
5. Enhanced validation to show workshop step data counts

## NEW EXPORT STRUCTURE:
The exported JSON now includes:
```json
{
  "userInfo": { ... },
  "navigationProgress": { ... },
  "assessments": { ... },
  "workshopStepData": {
    "ast": {
      "2-1": { "data": {...}, "version": 1, "createdAt": "...", "updatedAt": "..." },
      "2-2": { "data": {...}, "version": 1, "createdAt": "...", "updatedAt": "..." }
    },
    "ia": {
      "ia-3-4": { "data": {...}, "version": 1, "createdAt": "...", "updatedAt": "..." },
      "ia-3-5": { "data": {...}, "version": 1, "createdAt": "...", "updatedAt": "..." }
    }
  },
  "workshopParticipation": [ ... ],
  "exportMetadata": {
    "dataVersion": "2.1",
    "totalWorkshopSteps": 5,
    "workshopSteps": "AST: 2-1 through 4-5, IA: ia-1-1 through ia-4-6"
  }
}
```

## TO TEST:
1. Go to an IA workshop step (e.g., ia-3-4) and enter some data
2. Refresh to ensure it persists
3. Go to admin panel and export user data
4. Check that the exported JSON contains the IA data in the workshopStepData.ia section

## FILES MODIFIED:
- server/services/export-service.ts (updated to include workshop step data)

The IA workshop data should now be included in all user data exports!
