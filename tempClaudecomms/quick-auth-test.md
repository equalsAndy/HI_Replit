# Quick Authentication Fix

The issue is that while we commented out the Beta Tester fields from the schema, the Drizzle ORM might still have issues.

## Proven Facts:
✅ Database connection works
✅ User 'simple' exists with correct password hash
✅ Password 'test123' verifies correctly for user 'simple'
✅ Server is running and API endpoints respond

## The Problem:
❌ The Drizzle ORM query in authenticateUser() is failing somehow

## Quick Fix Options:

### Option 1: Temporarily use raw SQL in authenticateUser()
Replace the Drizzle query with raw SQL like we confirmed works

### Option 2: Completely regenerate the Drizzle schema
Remove all Beta Tester references and regenerate

### Option 3: Use existing user data you might have
If you have existing login credentials that worked before

## Immediate Test:
Try username: simple
Try password: test123

This should work based on our database verification.
