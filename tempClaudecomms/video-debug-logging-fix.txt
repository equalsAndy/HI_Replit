# Video Debug Logging Fix - KAN-134 Related
# Date: 2025-07-26 | Build: 2010

## ✅ ISSUE FIXED

### Problem:
Excessive console logging on every keystroke caused by video management system:
```
🎥 Found video for step ia-3-3: {title: 'Visualization Exercise', editableId: '7__r4FVj-EI'}
🎬 VideoPlayer Debug - Step: ia-3-3, Workshop: imaginal-agility
🎬 VideoByStepId: {id: 2, title: 'Visualization Exercise', editableId: '7__r4FVj-EI'}
🎬 VideoBySection: null
🎬 Selected video: {id: 2, title: 'Visualization Exercise', editableId: '7__r4FVj-EI'}
```

### Root Cause:
- `useVideoByStepId` hook was logging on every call
- `VideoPlayer` component was logging on every render  
- These were triggered by React re-renders on user input/keystroke

### Solution Applied:
Wrapped all video debug console logs in environment variable check:
```javascript
// OLD (always logged):
console.log(`🎥 Found video for step ${stepId}:`, video);

// NEW (only when debug enabled):
if (import.meta.env.DEV && import.meta.env.VITE_DEBUG_VIDEOS === 'true') {
  console.log(`🎥 Found video for step ${stepId}:`, video);
}
```

## 📁 Files Modified:
1. **client/src/hooks/use-videos.tsx**
   - Wrapped `useVideoByStepId` logging in debug flag
   - Wrapped `useVideoByStep` logging in debug flag

2. **client/src/components/content/VideoPlayer.tsx** 
   - Wrapped VideoPlayer debug logging in debug flag

## 🔧 How to Re-enable Debug Logging

### For Development Testing:
```bash
# Add to client/.env.development
VITE_DEBUG_VIDEOS=true

# Then restart dev server
cd client && npm run dev
```

### For Temporary Testing:
```bash
# Set environment variable for single session
VITE_DEBUG_VIDEOS=true npm run dev
```

### Admin Console Unaffected:
- Video management in admin console still works normally
- Database operations for video CRUD unchanged
- Only reduced console noise during normal user interaction

## ✅ Results:
- ❌ No more console spam on every keystroke
- ✅ Video management system still functional
- ✅ Admin video console features preserved  
- ✅ Debug logging available when needed via environment variable

## 🎯 Next Steps for KAN-134:
When ready to continue video tracking feature development:

1. Set `VITE_DEBUG_VIDEOS=true` in development environment
2. Implement YouTube API watch progress tracking
3. Store user video progress in database
4. Add progress tracking to admin dashboard
5. Remove debug flag once feature is stable

**Console is now clean for normal development! 🎉**
