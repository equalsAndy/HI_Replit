# IA Navigation Menu Changes Summary
**Date**: January 26, 2025
**Time**: ~2:30 AM PST

## Overview
Made significant changes to the Imaginal Agility (IA) navigation menu structure, disabling auto-expansion behavior and modifying section visibility.

## Previous Auto-Expansion Behavior (Now Disabled)

The navigation system had dynamic section expansion logic that would automatically show/hide sections based on user progress:

### How Auto-Expansion Worked:
1. **Initial State (Sections 1-3)**: 
   - Sections 1-3 started expanded
   - Sections 4-7 started collapsed

2. **Reaching Section 4 (ia-4-1)**:
   - Sections 1-2 would automatically collapse
   - Section 3 remained expanded
   - Section 4 would expand
   - Sections 5-7 remained locked/collapsed

3. **Workshop Completion (after ia-4-6)**:
   - Sections 1-3 would collapse
   - Section 4 remained expanded
   - Sections 5-7 would unlock and expand

This created a "progressive disclosure" pattern where the menu would guide users by showing relevant sections and hiding completed ones.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Disabled Auto-Expansion/Closing**
- Modified `calculateSectionExpansion()` in `/client/src/hooks/use-navigation-progress.ts`
- Replaced dynamic logic with static configuration:
  ```javascript
  // FIXED IA Section expansion - no auto expansion/closing
  const expansion = {
    '1': true,  // Welcome - always expanded
    '2': true,  // I4C Model - always expanded
    '3': true,  // Ladder of Imagination - always expanded
    '4': true,  // Advanced Ladder - always expanded
    '5': true,  // Outcomes & Benefits - always expanded
    '6': false, // Quarterly Tune-up - always collapsed
    '7': false  // Team Ladder - always collapsed
  };
  ```
- Sections 1-5 now always remain expanded
- Sections 6-7 always remain collapsed
- No automatic changes based on user progress

### 2. **Temporarily Hidden Section 5**
- Initially commented out entire "OUTCOMES & BENEFITS" section in `navigationData.ts`
- Later restored with only ia-5-1 visible (ia-5-2 through ia-5-5 remain hidden)

### 3. **Added "Coming Soon" Placeholder for Section 6**
- Replaced ia-6-1 (Orientation) and ia-6-2 (Practices) with single "Coming Soon" item
- Made non-clickable by:
  - Adding `step.type !== 'coming-soon'` check to onClick handler
  - Special styling: gray background, no hover effect, default cursor
  - Calendar icon to indicate future availability

### 4. **Modified ia-5-1 (Overview)**
- Changed from "HaiQ" assessment to "Overview" video
- Made unlocked from start (added to initial unlocked steps array)
- Created new content component with YouTube video: https://youtu.be/8URE4ruMkYs
- Simple layout with just title and video player

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. `/client/src/components/navigation/navigationData.ts`
   - Hidden/unhidden sections
   - Added "Coming Soon" placeholder
   - Renamed ia-5-1 to "Overview"

2. `/client/src/hooks/use-navigation-progress.ts`
   - Disabled auto-expansion logic
   - Made ia-5-1 unlocked from start
   - Removed console debug logs

3. `/client/src/components/navigation/UserHomeNavigationWithStarCard.tsx`
   - Added "coming-soon" type handling
   - Prevented clicks on coming soon items
   - Added visual styling for coming soon items

4. `/client/src/components/content/imaginal-agility/steps/IA_5_1_Content.tsx`
   - New file created for ia-5-1 video content

5. `/client/src/components/content/imaginal-agility/ImaginalAgilityContent.tsx`
   - Imported and registered new IA_5_1_Content component

## Result
The IA navigation now provides a stable, predictable structure where:
- Users see all available sections (1-5) expanded at all times
- Section 6 shows as "Coming Soon" and cannot be clicked
- Section 7 remains collapsed but accessible
- Section 8 remains completely hidden
- No surprising menu changes during user progression
- ia-5-1 "Overview" video is immediately accessible to all users
