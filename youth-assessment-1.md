## Scoring Algorithm
1. User ranks 4 options for each scenario (1-4, most to least like them)
2. Points assigned: Rank 1 = 3pts, Rank 2 = 2pts, Rank 3 = 1pt, Rank 4 = 0pts
3. Points summed by category across all 22 scenarios
4. Final scores converted to percentages totaling 100%
5. Results determine Star Card quadrant placement (same as adult assessment)

## Technical Implementation
- Will use same assessment interface and scoring logic as professional assessment
- Same category validation and balanced representation
- Compatible with existing `AssessmentQuestion` and `AssessmentOption` interfaces
- Uses same Star Card generation system
