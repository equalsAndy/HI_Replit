### üöÄ **How It Works:**

**For Steps 1-4 (Strength Reflections):**

- Coach knows user's specific strength being reflected on
- Provides targeted guidance for that strength area

**For Step 5 (Team Values):**
- Question: "What do you value most in team environments?"
- Coach helps explore team environment preferences
- Considers user's strength profile for recommendations

**For Step 6 (Unique Contribution):**
- Question: "What is your unique contribution to teams?"
- Coach helps identify unique value proposition
- References user's specific strength combination

1. **Visible Integration**: Each reflection step has a coaching button
2. **Contextual Help**: Coach knows exactly what question user is working on
3. **Personalized Responses**: AI uses user's Star Card data + current question
4. **Scrollable Interface**: Long responses scroll properly within modal
5. **Clear Context**: Current question displayed prominently in modal
