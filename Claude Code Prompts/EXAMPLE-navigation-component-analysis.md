# CLAUDE CODE: Navigation Component Analysis

## 🎯 Objective
Analyze the shared navigation component and understand how the `isImaginalAgility` prop controls AST vs IA workshop routing.

## 📁 Focus Files
- Primary: `/client/src/components/navigation/NavigationComponent.tsx`
- Context: `/client/src/pages/allstarteams.tsx` and `/client/src/pages/imaginal-agility.tsx`

## ⚠️ Constraints
- Workshop: Shared component (affects both AST and IA)
- Do not modify - analysis only
- Understand separation logic

## 🔧 Technical Requirements
- React TypeScript component
- Props interface analysis
- Workshop-specific logic identification
- Route handling patterns

## ✅ Success Criteria
- Clear understanding of how navigation switches between workshops
- Identification of AST vs IA specific logic
- Documentation of prop flow and state management

## 📋 Steps
1. Examine the NavigationComponent structure
2. Trace the `isImaginalAgility` prop usage
3. Identify workshop-specific conditional rendering
4. Map out the navigation flow for both workshops
5. Document any shared vs workshop-specific elements

## 📝 Expected Output
- Summary of navigation architecture
- Key differences between AST and IA navigation
- Recommendations for future navigation modifications
