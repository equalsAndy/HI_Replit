# KAN-147 Completion Prompt for Claude.ai

## Context
You are working on JIRA ticket KAN-147 "Performance Optimization and Bundle Analysis" for a dual-workshop platform (AST/IA). Previous implementation work has been completed with mixed results - bundle analysis succeeded but code splitting had to be reverted due to technical issues.

## Current Project State
- **Application**: Fully functional, all features working
- **Bundle Analysis**: Successfully implemented with rollup-plugin-visualizer
- **Code Splitting**: Reverted to static imports due to module conflicts
- **Performance**: Back to baseline (582 kB gzipped main bundle)
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive implementation report available

## Your Task: Complete KAN-147 Implementation

### Primary Objectives
1. **Review the implementation report** at `/JiraTickets/KAN-147-implementation-report.md`
2. **Update JIRA ticket KAN-147** with current status and next steps
3. **Implement remaining acceptance criteria** that are safely achievable
4. **Plan future code splitting implementation** based on lessons learned

### Specific Actions Required

#### 1. Ticket Status Update
- Update KAN-147 status to reflect current completion state
- Add implementation report findings to ticket comments
- Adjust acceptance criteria based on technical constraints discovered
- Set realistic timeline for remaining work

#### 2. Performance Monitoring Implementation
The bundle analysis tools are in place but need monitoring integration:
- Set up automated bundle size tracking
- Implement performance budgets with alerts
- Create dashboard for ongoing monitoring
- Document monitoring procedures

#### 3. Documentation Completion
- Ensure all bundle analysis results are properly documented
- Create troubleshooting guide for future code splitting attempts
- Update project README with performance optimization info
- Document the dependency mapping process

#### 4. Future Code Splitting Strategy
Based on lessons learned, create implementation plan for:
- Dependency audit methodology
- Incremental workshop-by-workshop approach
- Error boundary improvements
- Module resolution conflict prevention

### Technical Constraints to Remember
- **Never mix import patterns**: Components must be either lazy OR static, not both
- **Audit dependencies first**: Map all component relationships before changes
- **Incremental approach**: One workshop at a time to isolate issues
- **Maintain application stability**: Always have rollback plan ready

### Available Resources
- Bundle analysis tools in `/client/vite.config.ts`
- Implementation report at `/JiraTickets/KAN-147-implementation-report.md`
- Bundle results documentation in `/docs/KAN-147-BUNDLE-ANALYSIS-RESULTS.md`
- Working application on `feature/kan-147-code-splitting` branch

### Success Criteria for This Session
- [ ] KAN-147 ticket accurately reflects current state
- [ ] Performance monitoring system operational
- [ ] Documentation complete and accessible
- [ ] Clear roadmap for future code splitting work
- [ ] No regression in application functionality

### Key Metrics Achieved
- **Bundle Analysis**: ✅ Working tool generating detailed reports
- **Code Splitting Proof**: ✅ Demonstrated 72% bundle reduction possible
- **Performance Baseline**: ✅ 582 kB gzipped main bundle established
- **Error Recovery**: ✅ Successful rollback maintaining stability

### What NOT to Do
- Do not attempt to re-implement lazy loading without dependency audit
- Do not modify existing import patterns without comprehensive testing
- Do not remove bundle analysis tools (they're working correctly)
- Do not change the application's core functionality

## Expected Deliverables
1. Updated JIRA ticket KAN-147 with accurate status
2. Functional performance monitoring system
3. Complete documentation package
4. Implementation roadmap for future code splitting work
5. Any additional optimizations that can be safely implemented

Begin by reading the implementation report, then proceed with updating the JIRA ticket and implementing the remaining safely achievable objectives.
