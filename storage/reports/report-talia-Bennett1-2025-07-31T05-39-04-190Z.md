4. Finally, you move into focused execution (10% Acting)

### Your Unique Operating System

Your assessment data reveals a sophisticated operating system that combines big-picture thinking with methodical execution.

### Understanding Your Supporting Strengths

Your Feeling strength (20%) acts as a crucial moderator, ensuring your analytical and planning capabilities remain grounded in human impact.
