# AWS Deployment Testing & Migration Strategy

## üéØ **Understanding What You're Deploying**

### **Production Build vs Development Environment**

| Aspect | Replit Dev Environment | AWS Production Deployment |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Build Process** | `npm run dev` (hot-reload) | `npm run build` (optimized) |
| **Environment** | `NODE_ENV=development` | `NODE_ENV=production` |
| **Assets** | Unoptimized, served by Vite | Minified, bundled, static |
| **Database** | Development URLs/config | Production URLs/config |
| **Performance** | Slower, with dev tools | Optimized for speed |
| **Debugging** | Full dev tools, console logs | Limited logging |
| **File Serving** | Dynamic compilation | Pre-built static files |

### **Key Implications**
- **Different behavior possible**: Production optimizations may expose issues not seen in dev
- **Database connections**: May use different connection strings/configs
- **Error handling**: Production mode often hides detailed error messages
- **Asset loading**: Different paths and optimization levels

## üß™ **Recommended Testing Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Production Deployment Testing (Current)**
**Goal**: Verify AWS deployment works without disrupting development

#### **Step 1: Complete Current Deployment**
1. Wait for ECR push to finish
2. Deploy to Lightsail container service
3. Verify deployment shows "RUNNING" status

#### **Step 2: Comprehensive Production Testing**
```bash
# Basic connectivity
curl https://hi-replit-app.tqr7xha9v8ynw.us-west-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com/

# Test key endpoints
curl https://hi-replit-app.tqr7xha9v8ynw.us-west-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com/api/health
curl https://hi-replit-app.tqr7xha9v8ynw.us-west-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com/api/auth/status
```

#### **Step 3: Feature Verification Checklist**
- [ ] **Home page loads** correctly
- [ ] **User authentication** works (login/logout)
- [ ] **Database connections** functional
- [ ] **API endpoints** responding
- [ ] **File uploads** (if applicable) working
- [ ] **Workshop functionality** accessible
- [ ] **Admin features** operational
- [ ] **Mobile responsiveness** maintained

#### **Step 4: Performance Baseline**
- [ ] Page load times under 3 seconds
- [ ] No JavaScript console errors
- [ ] Database queries responding quickly
- [ ] Memory usage reasonable

### **Phase 2: Parallel Development Approach**
**Goal**: Maintain development capability while testing production

#### **Development Workflow**
- **Keep Replit active** for daily development
- **Use AWS for stakeholder demos** and production testing
- **Test new features** on AWS before considering them complete
- **Document differences** between environments

#### **Risk Mitigation**
- **No disruption** to current development workflow
- **Ability to rollback** to Replit if AWS issues arise
- **Gradual transition** rather than sudden cutover
- **Learning curve** managed without pressure

### **Phase 3: Full Migration Planning**
**Goal**: Complete transition to local development + AWS production

#### **Prerequisites for Migration**
- [ ] AWS production deployment stable for 1+ week
- [ ] All major features tested and working
- [ ] Performance meets requirements
- [ ] Database migration (if needed) planned
- [ ] File cleanup completed
- [ ] Local development environment configured

## üßπ **File Cleanup Strategy**

### **Pre-Migration Cleanup Assessment**

#### **Discovery Commands**
```bash
# Find potential screenshot files
find . -name "*.png" -size +100k | grep -E "(screen|shot|demo|test)"

# Identify large files that might be unnecessary
find . -size +10M -type f

# Check for backup and temporary files
find . -name "*.bak" -o -name "*~" -o -name "*.tmp" -o -name ".DS_Store"

# Identify unused dependencies (after migration)
npm ls --depth=0 | grep "UNMET DEPENDENCY\|extraneous"
```

#### **Safe to Remove Categories**
- **Screenshots**: Demo images, test captures, documentation images not in production
- **Development artifacts**: `.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`, editor temp files
- **Backup files**: `*.bak`, `*.orig`, `*~` files
- **Old build artifacts**: Previous `dist/`, `build/` folders
- **Unused assets**: Images/files not referenced in code

#### **Cleanup Validation Process**
1. **Create backup branch** before cleanup
2. **Test thoroughly** after each cleanup batch
3. **Document what was removed** for reference
4. **Verify build process** still works correctly

### **Cleanup Timing Recommendations**
- **Before migration**: Remove obvious junk files (screenshots, temp files)
- **After AWS testing**: Remove files confirmed as unused
- **During migration**: Deep clean as part of dev environment setup
- **Post-migration**: Ongoing maintenance to prevent accumulation

## üìÅ **Document Storage Recommendations**

### **Current Migration Documents Storage**

#### **Option 1: Project Documentation Folder (Recommended)**
```
/Users/bradtopliff/Desktop/HI_Replit/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aws-migration-session4-handoff.md
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ aws-lightsail-deployment-guide.md
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment-testing-strategy.md
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ file-cleanup-checklist.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ development/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture/
```

#### **Option 2: Root Level Documentation**
```
/Users/bradtopliff/Desktop/HI_Replit/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ AWS-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MIGRATION-HANDOFF.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ TESTING-STRATEGY.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other project files]
```

#### **Option 3: Git-Tracked Documentation Branch**
```bash
# Create documentation branch
git checkout -b documentation/aws-migration
# Add all migration docs
# Keep separate from main development
```

### **Recommended Approach**
**Use Option 1** - Create `docs/deployment/` folder:

```bash
# Create documentation structure
mkdir -p docs/deployment
mkdir -p docs/development
mkdir -p docs/architecture

# Move migration documents there
# Keep them version controlled with project
# Easy to reference during development
```

### **Document Lifecycle Management**
- **Handoff documents**: Keep until migration complete, then archive
- **Deployment guides**: Maintain as living documentation
- **Testing strategies**: Update based on actual deployment experience
- **Cleanup checklists**: Remove after cleanup complete

## üéØ **Success Criteria for Each Phase**

### **Phase 1 Complete When:**
- [ ] AWS deployment accessible and functional
- [ ] All core features tested and working
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] No critical issues identified

### **Phase 2 Complete When:**
- [ ] Parallel development workflow established
- [ ] AWS stability proven over time
- [ ] Development team comfortable with new process
- [ ] Migration plan finalized

### **Phase 3 Complete When:**
- [ ] Local development environment fully functional
- [ ] Replit dependency eliminated
- [ ] File cleanup completed
- [ ] Team transitioned to new workflow

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Risk Management**

### **Potential Issues to Monitor**
- **Environment-specific bugs** (production vs development)
- **Database connection differences**
- **Asset loading problems** in production build
- **Performance degradation** compared to Replit
- **Authentication/session handling** differences

### **Rollback Plans**
- **Phase 1**: Continue using Replit for development
- **Phase 2**: Maintain Replit access during transition
- **Phase 3**: Keep AWS deployment separate from development changes

**Recommended Next Step**: Complete Phase 1 testing of current AWS deployment before making any file cleanup or migration decisions.
