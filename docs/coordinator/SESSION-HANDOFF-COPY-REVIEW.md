# SESSION HANDOFF - IA Copy Content Review
*Created: June 28, 2025*

## CURRENT STATE:
**Working on:** IA Workshop copy content restoration and design review
**Last completed:** Replit Agent executed content restoration 
**Status:** Ready for copy review before Git commit

## COPY RESTORATION COMPLETED:
Replit Agent restored original content for these steps:

### **ia-2-1: The Triple Challenge**
**Original Spec:**
- Simple intro: "As artificial intelligence accelerates, it's causing a serious decline..."
- **Correct Triple Challenge:**
  1. **Metacognitive Laziness**: Outsourcing thinking and sense-making
  2. **Imagination Deficit**: Diminishing the generative core of human potential  
  3. **Psychological Debt**: Fatigue, disconnection, and loss of purpose

### **ia-3-1: Imaginal Agility Solution** 
**Original Spec:**
- "Imagination is a primal human power â€” not content with what we know, but impelled to ask: 'What if?'"
- Simple Five Core Capabilities list
- "Upon viewing the video, please click on the button below to complete your Core Capabilities Self-Assessment."

### **ia-6-1: Teamwork Preparation**
**Original Spec:**
- "Welcome to the next stage of the Imaginal Agility Workshop"
- "Now that you've completed your self-assessment and explored your radar profile..."
- What to Expect, What You Leave With sections

### **ia-8-1: The Neuroscience**
**Original Spec:**
- "The Neuroscience of Imagination"
- "Modern neuroscience reveals that imagination isn't just creativity..."
- Key Brain Networks, Journey Completion content

## REVIEW TASKS:

### **1. Content Verification**
**Check each step against original specification:**
- [ ] ia-2-1: Verify Triple Challenge uses correct 3 challenges
- [ ] ia-3-1: Verify simple direct messaging restored  
- [ ] ia-6-1: Verify teamwork preparation content matches spec
- [ ] ia-8-1: Verify neuroscience content matches spec

### **2. Design Integration**
**Verify original content works with new visual design:**
- [ ] Text layout and spacing
- [ ] Section headers and organization  
- [ ] Video integration with content
- [ ] Call-to-action buttons placement

### **3. Capability Graphics**
**Check 5 capability graphics integration:**
- [ ] Graphics appear in ia-3-1 capabilities section
- [ ] Proper sizing and alignment
- [ ] Accessible from public/assets/

## COMPARISON REFERENCE:
Use the implementation document content (shared earlier) as the source of truth for what content should be.

## TESTING STEPS:
1. **Load each IA step** and read through content
2. **Compare against original spec** word-for-word
3. **Check visual presentation** with restored copy
4. **Verify capability graphics** display properly
5. **Test user flow** through restored content

## DECISION POINTS:
- **If copy matches original:** Approve and commit changes
- **If copy still differs:** Create specific fix prompts for remaining issues
- **If design conflicts:** Adjust design to work with original copy

## FOR NEW CHAT:
Start with: "Review IA workshop copy restoration - need to verify content matches original specification before committing changes."

## COMMIT READINESS:
**DO NOT commit until copy review is complete and approved.**

## ORIGINAL CONTENT REFERENCE:
- Implementation document specifications
- Your uploaded content examples
