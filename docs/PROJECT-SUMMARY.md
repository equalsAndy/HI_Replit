**Key Features:**
```typescript
class VectorDBService {
  // Connection management
  async testConnection(): Promise<boolean>
  async initializeCollections(): Promise<boolean>
  
  // Knowledge base operations
  async addKnowledgeContent(content: string, metadata: any, id: string)
  async searchKnowledge(query: string, limit?: number)
  
  // Team matching operations
  async addTeamProfile(profile: any, id: string)
  async findSimilarTeams(targetProfile: any, limit?: number)
}
```

### API Infrastructure

**Coaching Routes (`/api/coaching`):**
- `GET/POST /vector/status` - Vector database health checks
- `POST /vector/init` - Initialize vector collections
- `GET/POST /knowledge` - Knowledge base operations
- `GET/POST /profiles` - User profile management
- `GET /connections/similar` - Team member matching
- `POST /sessions` - Coaching session tracking

**System Administration:**
- `POST /create-coaching-tables` - One-time database setup
