# Future Features & Fixes Backlog

## üìã About This Document

This file tracks feature requests, bugs, and improvements that come up during development but aren't addressed in the current chat session. Use this to maintain continuity across development sessions and ensure nothing gets lost.

## üéØ How to Use This Document

### **For Development Sessions:**
- **Add items** when features/fixes are identified but not implemented
- **Move items** from "Backlog" to "In Progress" when working on them
- **Move items** to "Completed" when finished
- **Include context** about why the item is needed and any implementation notes

### **For Claude/AI Assistants:**
- **Always check this file** at the start of new development sessions
- **Ask the user** if they want to work on any backlog items
- **Update this file** when new items are discovered or completed
- **Reference this file** when planning development priorities

## ‚úÖ Completed Items

### **Recent Completions** *(Move items here when finished)*

- ‚úÖ **Test user progress display bug** *(2025-06-28)* - Fixed step ID mapping to show correct sequential progress (4-1 ‚Üí step 10 of 14)
- ‚úÖ **Admin export permissions** *(2025-06-28)* - Allow admins to access any user data while maintaining security for self-access
- ‚úÖ **Data export consistency** *(2025-06-28)* - Unified admin and test user export formats to use identical structure
- ‚úÖ **Function hoisting error** *(2025-06-28)* - Fixed "Cannot access before initialization" error by moving helper functions before usage
- ‚úÖ **Step number calculation** *(2025-06-28)* - Created proper mapping from AST step IDs to sequential positions (1-1=1, 2-1=2, ..., 4-1=10)
- ‚úÖ **Admin role detection** *(2025-06-28)* - Fixed permission check to use session.userRole instead of session.role
- ‚úÖ **Workshop step count accuracy** *(2025-06-28)* - Corrected AST workshop to show 14 steps instead of 19 (removed non-workshop steps from count)

## üìù Implementation Notes

### **Development Patterns Established**
- Use precision prompts for complex multi-file changes
- Claude direct editing for simple 1-2 file modifications
- Always test both admin and test user workflows when making changes
- Maintain separation between AST and IA workshop logic

### **Architecture Decisions**
- Test users use admin export endpoint with self-access permissions (session.userRole === 'admin' OR sessionUserId === requestedUserId)
- Workshop step IDs map to sequential numbers for display (4-1 ‚Üí step 10 of 14) using astStepOrder lookup table
- Navigation progress stored separately for AST and IA workshops in navigationProgress.ast and navigationProgress.ia objects
- Shared components use `isImaginalAgility` prop for workshop differentiation
- AST workshop has 14 actual steps (1-1 through 4-5), not 19 as originally implemented
- Helper functions must be defined before useMemo hooks that reference them to avoid hoisting errors

### **Testing Checklist Template**
When implementing new features, test:
- [ ] Admin user functionality
- [ ] Test user functionality  
- [ ] AST workshop behavior
- [ ] IA workshop behavior
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Data export/import consistency
