## üìù Implementation Notes

### **Youth Participant Implementation Notes** *(June 2025)*
- **Database Schema**: 'student' role implemented with UserRoles constant and UserRole type for type safety
- **Assessment Architecture**: Role-based loading system allows different question sets while maintaining identical interface and scoring
- **Question Structure**: Youth scenarios follow same 4-category mapping (thinking/acting/feeling/planning) as professional assessment
- **Testing Limitation**: Full student flow testing requires admin invite creation UI to generate student invite codes
- **Future Expansion**: Assessment variation framework established for additional user types or question sets

### **Development Workflow Improvements Identified** *(June 2025)*
- **Claude System Instructions Enhancement**: Need project-aware instructions that include workshop separation rules, error prevention patterns, and Heliotrope-specific constraints to eliminate architecture re-explanation in each session
- **Documentation Structure Optimization**: Current docs have overlapping information across three files - could benefit from hierarchy with quick-reference sheet for common operations
- **Workflow Decision Framework**: Three hats analysis revealed need for better error prevention (Black Hat), workflow optimization (Yellow Hat), and creative development approaches (Green Hat)
- **Automatic Workshop Identification**: Claude should verify AST vs IA context before making any changes to prevent cross-workshop contamination
- **Built-in Quality Assurance**: System instructions should include verification steps and success criteria for each type of change

### **Development Patterns Established**
- Use precision prompts for complex multi-file changes
- Claude direct editing for simple 1-2 file modifications
- Always test both admin and test user workflows when making changes
- Maintain separation between AST and IA workshop logic
- Enhanced Claude instructions should include automatic workshop identification and verification steps
- **Logo troubleshooting pattern**: Route detection ‚Üí Component prop flow ‚Üí Logo component type ‚Üí Console debugging ‚Üí Systematic fix
- **Routing architecture**: Separate page components for workshops (/imaginal-agility ‚Üí imaginal-agility.tsx, /allstarteams ‚Üí allstarteams.tsx)

### **Database Migration Implementation Notes** *(July 2025)*
- **Current Setup**: Neon PostgreSQL (AWS-based, serverless, usage-based pricing)
- **Target Setup**: AWS Lightsail Managed Database (predictable costs, same datacenter as container)
- **Migration Process**: pg_dump export ‚Üí Lightsail import ‚Üí connection string update ‚Üí thorough testing
- **Cost Analysis**: Lightsail $15-60/month vs Neon usage-based (need to evaluate current costs)
- **Benefits**: Infrastructure consolidation, predictable costs, lower latency, more database control
- **Considerations**: Migration complexity, potential downtime, current Neon setup already working well
- **Recommendation**: Evaluate current Neon costs first, plan migration during low-usage period

### **Architecture Decisions**
- Test users use admin export endpoint with self-access permissions (session.userRole === 'admin' OR sessionUserId === requestedUserId)
- Workshop step IDs map to sequential numbers for display (4-1 ‚Üí step 10 of 14) using astStepOrder lookup table
- Navigation progress stored separately for AST and IA workshops in navigationProgress.ast and navigationProgress.ia objects
- Shared components use `isImaginalAgility` prop for workshop differentiation
- AST workshop has 14 actual steps (1-1 through 4-5), not 19 as originally implemented
- Helper functions must be defined before useMemo hooks that reference them to avoid hoisting errors
- **Logo component architecture**: Centralized Logo.tsx component handles all three logo types (allstarteams, imaginal-agility, heliotrope) with proper Vite asset bundling
- **Workshop routing separation**: Each workshop has dedicated page component that sets correct currentApp state for proper logo detection
- **Logo sizing approach**: Width-based responsive sizing (w-48 h-auto) instead of height-based to accommodate different aspect ratios
- **Student assessment architecture**: Same assessment interface and scoring system with role-based question loading for seamless user experience

### **Testing Checklist Template**
When implementing new features, test:
- [ ] Admin user functionality
- [ ] Test user functionality  
- [ ] AST workshop behavior
- [ ] IA workshop behavior
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Data export/import consistency
- [ ] Student user role functionality (when invite creation UI complete)
