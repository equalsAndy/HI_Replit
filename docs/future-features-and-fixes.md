## üìù Implementation Notes

### **Development Patterns Established**
- Use precision prompts for complex multi-file changes
- Claude direct editing for simple 1-2 file modifications
- Always test both admin and test user workflows when making changes
- Maintain separation between AST and IA workshop logic

### **Architecture Decisions**
- Test users use admin export endpoint with self-access permissions
- Workshop step IDs map to sequential numbers for display (4-1 ‚Üí step 10 of 14)
- Navigation progress stored separately for AST and IA workshops
- Shared components use `isImaginalAgility` prop for workshop differentiation

### **Testing Checklist Template**
When implementing new features, test:
- [ ] Admin user functionality
- [ ] Test user functionality  
- [ ] AST workshop behavior
- [ ] IA workshop behavior
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Data export/import consistency
