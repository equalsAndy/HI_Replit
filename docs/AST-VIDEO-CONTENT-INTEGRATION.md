# AST Video Content Database Integration
*Complete implementation documentation*

## 🎯 Overview
This document details the comprehensive AST video content integration that fixes duplicate video IDs, establishes proper step-to-video mapping, and provides enhanced video content with transcripts and glossaries.

## 🔧 Key Issues Fixed

### 1. Duplicate Video ID Resolution
**Problem:** Multiple AST steps were using the same video IDs, causing conflicts:
- Steps 1-2 and 2-1 both used `TN5b8jx7KSI`
- Step 2-2 was missing its proper video content

**Solution:** Each step now has a unique, verified YouTube video ID:

| Step ID | Title | YouTube ID | Status |
|---------|-------|------------|--------|
| 1-1 | On Self-Awareness | `pp2wrqE8r2o` | ✅ Unique |
| 1-2 | The Self-Awareness Opportunity | `TN5b8jx7KSI` | ✅ Unique |
| 1-3 | About this Course | `JJWb058M-sY` | ✅ Unique |
| 2-1 | Star Strengths Assessment | `8K_9lAFvxGo` | ✅ Fixed (was duplicate) |
| 2-2 | Flow Patterns | `KGv31SFLKC0` | ✅ Fixed (was missing) |
| 2-3 | Review Your Star Card | `mJ3k7DY9i8Q` | ✅ Fixed (was duplicate) |
| 3-1 | Well-Being Ladder | `SjEfwPEl65U` | ✅ Repositioned |
| 3-2 | Rounding Out | `BBAx5dNZw6Y` | ✅ Unique |
| 5-1 | Your Future Self | `9Q5JMKoSFVk` | ✅ Repositioned |

### 2. Step Positioning Corrections
**Corrections Made:**
- **Well-Being Ladder**: Moved from incorrect position `4-1` to correct position `3-1`
- **Your Future Self**: Moved from position `4-4` to correct position `5-1`
- **Flow Patterns**: Added to correct position `2-2` (was missing)
