  "details": "Additional error information"
}
```

### Common Error Codes
- `AUTH_REQUIRED`: Authentication required
- `INVALID_INPUT`: Request validation failed
- `VECTOR_DB_ERROR`: Vector database operation failed
- `DB_CONNECTION_ERROR`: Database connection failed
- `NOT_FOUND`: Requested resource not found

## Rate Limiting

Current implementation has no rate limiting. Future considerations:
- API key-based rate limiting
- User-based request quotas
- Vector search operation limits

## Development vs Production

### Current State (Development)
- Basic endpoint structure implemented
- Vector database operations functional
- Authentication integration ready
- Database table creation completed

### Planned Production Features
- Full CRUD operations for all endpoints
- Advanced search and filtering
- Batch operations for data management
- Comprehensive error handling
- Rate limiting and security measures

## Testing

### Integration Test Script
```bash
./final-test.sh
```

### Individual Endpoint Testing
```bash
# Vector database
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/coaching/vector/status"
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/coaching/vector/init"

# Basic endpoints
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/coaching/knowledge"
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/coaching/profiles"
```

### Expected Test Results
All endpoints should return JSON responses with appropriate status codes and no server errors in the development environment.

## Next Development Steps

1. **Implement Full Database Operations**: Replace placeholder responses with actual database queries
2. **Add Authentication Middleware**: Integrate with existing AST authentication system
3. **Enhance Vector Search**: Add AWS Bedrock embeddings for better semantic understanding
4. **Add Data Validation**: Implement request validation and sanitization
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
6. **Performance Optimization**: Query optimization and caching strategies

This API provides the foundation for intelligent coaching features while integrating seamlessly with the existing AllStarTeams platform.
