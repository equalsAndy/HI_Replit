## Training System

### Overview
The training system allows administrators to continuously improve Talia's coaching effectiveness through direct feedback and learning sessions.

### Training Commands

#### Starting Training Mode
- **Command:** `TRAIN` (in any Talia conversation)
- **Effect:** Activates training mode for feedback collection
- **Available For:** All Talia personas

#### Training Session Flow
1. Admin types `TRAIN` in conversation
2. Talia enters training mode
3. Admin provides feedback, examples, and improvements
4. Admin says "done", "finished", or "exit" to save training
5. Training is automatically integrated into Talia's knowledge

#### Example Training Session
```
Admin: TRAIN
Talia: 🎓 **TRAINING MODE ACTIVATED**
       How would you like me to improve?

Admin: When users ask about their strengths, focus more on practical applications rather than theoretical descriptions

Talia: I understand. You'd like me to emphasize practical, real-world applications of strengths rather than staying theoretical. Can you give me an example of how you'd prefer me to respond?

Admin: Instead of saying "You have high Strategic thinking," say something like "Your Strategic thinking helps you see patterns others miss - like when you anticipate project roadblocks before they happen"

Talia: That's excellent feedback! So I should connect strengths to specific behavioral examples and practical outcomes. This makes the coaching more actionable and relatable. Any other aspects you'd like me to adjust?

Admin: done

Talia: Training session completed! I've learned from our conversation...
```

### Training Data Management

#### Accessing Training History
- **Admin Console:** Report Talia can discuss training conversation history
- **File Storage:** `storage/talia-training.json` (development)
- **Database:** Training sessions logged in usage analytics
