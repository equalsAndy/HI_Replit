# KAN-147 Future Code Splitting Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step approach for safely implementing code splitting to achieve the proven 72% bundle reduction (639 KB → 165 KB gzipped) while avoiding the module resolution conflicts encountered in the initial implementation.

## Current Status
- **Bundle Analysis**: ✅ Complete with automated tracking
- **Performance Budgets**: ✅ Implemented with alerting
- **Code Splitting POC**: ⚠️ Reverted due to module conflicts
- **Monitoring**: ✅ Full tracking and documentation

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Mixed Import Patterns
The implementation failure was caused by components being imported both lazily and statically:
- `ContentViews.tsx`: Lazy import of `ImaginalAgilityContent`
- Workshop pages: Direct import of `ImaginalAgilityContent`
- Result: Module bundler couldn't resolve conflicts

### Secondary Issues
1. **Insufficient dependency mapping**: Didn't audit all component relationships
2. **Circular dependencies**: Components created import cycles
3. **Error boundaries**: Limited fallback handling for loading failures

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

### Step 1.1: Dependency Audit
**Goal**: Map all component import relationships to identify conflicts

**Tasks**:
1. Create dependency mapping script:
   ```bash
   # scripts/analyze-dependencies.js
   # Scan all .tsx/.ts files for import statements
   # Generate dependency graph
   # Identify circular dependencies
   ```

2. Manual audit of workshop components:
   - AllStarTeams components and dependencies
   - ImaginalAgility components and dependencies
   - Admin dashboard components
   - Shared component usage

3. Document findings in dependency matrix

**Deliverables**:
- `docs/dependency-analysis.md`
- `scripts/analyze-dependencies.js`
- Visual dependency graph (if tools available)

### Step 1.2: Import Pattern Standardization
**Goal**: Establish consistent import patterns across codebase

**Rules**:
- **Workshop pages**: Always lazy imports in App.tsx
- **Content components**: Always direct imports within workshop context
- **Shared components**: Always direct imports
- **Utility modules**: Always direct imports

**Tasks**:
1. Update ESLint rules to enforce import patterns
2. Create import pattern documentation
3. Refactor any violations found in audit

**Deliverables**:
- Updated ESLint configuration
- Import pattern documentation
- Cleaned codebase with consistent patterns

### Step 1.3: Enhanced Error Boundaries
**Goal**: Better error handling and debugging for lazy loading

**Tasks**:
1. Create workshop-specific error boundaries:
   ```typescript
   // WorkshopErrorBoundary.tsx
   // Specific fallbacks for each workshop type
   // Error reporting and recovery options
   ```

2. Add loading state management:
   ```typescript
   // Enhanced WorkshopLoader with timeout
   // Progress indicators
   // Error recovery options
   ```

3. Implement development-only debugging tools:
   - Module resolution logging
   - Import path tracking
   - Loading failure diagnostics

**Deliverables**:
- `WorkshopErrorBoundary.tsx`
- Enhanced `WorkshopLoader.tsx`
- Development debugging utilities

## Phase 2: Incremental Implementation (Week 2)

### Step 2.1: Single Workshop Trial (AI Training)
**Goal**: Implement lazy loading for one workshop to validate approach

**Why AI Training**:
- Smallest bundle (10 KB gzipped)
- Least dependencies
- Admin-only (limited user impact)
- Easiest to rollback

**Tasks**:
1. Implement lazy loading for AI Training only:
   ```typescript
   // App.tsx - only AI Training lazy loaded
   const AiTrainingPage = React.lazy(() => import('@/pages/ai-training'));
   ```

2. Test thoroughly:
   - Loading states work correctly
   - No module resolution conflicts
   - Error boundaries function properly
   - Performance improvement measurable

3. Monitor for 48 hours in development

**Success Criteria**:
- AI Training loads without infinite spinner
- Bundle size reduces measurably
- No new errors in console
- All existing functionality preserved

### Step 2.2: Admin Dashboard Implementation
**Goal**: Add second workshop to validate pattern

**Tasks**:
1. Add Admin Dashboard to lazy loading
2. Test both AI Training and Admin Dashboard
3. Verify no cross-contamination
4. Measure cumulative bundle improvement

**Success Criteria**:
- Both admin components load correctly
- Further bundle size reduction
- No regression in AI Training functionality

### Step 2.3: Workshop Component Isolation
**Goal**: Ensure workshop components are properly isolated

**Tasks**:
1. Audit workshop-specific content components
2. Ensure no shared state between lazy-loaded workshops
3. Test workshop switching scenarios
4. Validate session persistence

## Phase 3: Primary Workshops (Week 3)

### Step 3.1: AllStar Teams Implementation
**Goal**: Implement lazy loading for AST workshop

**Special Considerations**:
- Largest workshop codebase
- Many shared components
- High user impact
- Complex navigation

**Tasks**:
1. Pre-implementation dependency check
2. Gradual rollout with feature flag
3. A/B testing with subset of users
4. Performance monitoring during rollout

### Step 3.2: Imaginal Agility Implementation
**Goal**: Complete lazy loading implementation

**Special Considerations**:
- Previous conflict source
- ContentViews.tsx integration
- Multiple workshop entry points
- Complex component hierarchy

**Tasks**:
1. Extra careful dependency audit
2. Staged implementation with extensive testing
3. Fallback mechanisms for loading failures
4. User experience validation

## Phase 4: Optimization & Monitoring (Week 4)

### Step 4.1: Performance Validation
**Goal**: Confirm 72% bundle reduction achieved

**Metrics to Track**:
- Bundle size reduction percentage
- Time to Interactive improvement
- Largest Contentful Paint scores
- User-reported loading issues

### Step 4.2: Production Rollout
**Goal**: Deploy to production with monitoring

**Rollout Strategy**:
1. Staging environment validation (48 hours)
2. Canary deployment (10% of users, 24 hours)
3. Gradual rollout (50% of users, 48 hours)
4. Full deployment (100% of users)

**Monitoring**:
- Bundle size tracking
- Error rate monitoring
- User experience metrics
- Rollback triggers

### Step 4.3: Documentation & Knowledge Transfer
**Goal**: Document successful implementation

**Deliverables**:
- Implementation success report
- Updated development guidelines
- Troubleshooting guide
- Performance optimization playbook

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Scenarios
1. **Module resolution conflicts**: Comprehensive dependency audit prevents
2. **User experience degradation**: Incremental rollout with monitoring
3. **Loading failures**: Enhanced error boundaries and fallbacks
4. **Performance regression**: Continuous monitoring with alerts

### Rollback Triggers
- Bundle size doesn't improve by >50%
- Error rates increase by >5%
- User complaints about loading issues
- Any component fails to load consistently

### Rollback Plan
1. Immediate: Revert to static imports in App.tsx
2. Preserve: Bundle analysis and monitoring tools
3. Investigate: Root cause analysis for future attempts
4. Timeline: <2 hours to restore full functionality

## Implementation Notes

### Key Lessons from Initial Attempt
1. **Dependency mapping is critical**: Can't skip the audit phase
2. **Incremental approach essential**: Don't try to implement everything at once
3. **Error boundaries required**: Lazy loading needs proper fallbacks
4. **Monitoring is invaluable**: Track progress and catch regressions early

### Tools and Resources
- Bundle analysis: Already implemented in `vite.config.ts`
- Performance tracking: `scripts/bundle-size-check.js`
- Documentation: This plan and implementation report
- Monitoring: `docs/performance-tracking/README.md`

### Next Steps
1. **Schedule implementation**: Plan 4-week implementation window
2. **Assign ownership**: Designate lead developer for each phase
3. **Set up testing environment**: Ensure safe space for experimentation
4. **Communicate timeline**: Keep stakeholders informed of progress

This plan transforms the initial KAN-147 experiment into a systematic, risk-mitigated approach that should successfully achieve the 72% bundle reduction while maintaining application stability and user experience.
