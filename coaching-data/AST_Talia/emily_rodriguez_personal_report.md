## Your Well-being Journey: From 5 to 7

Your current position at level 5 on the well-being ladder is honest and realistic. You recognize that while your job provides stability and you enjoy your coworkers, there's room for improvement in confidence and work-life balance.

### Pathway to Level 7

**Building Technical Confidence**: Your desire to understand the technical aspects better is achievable and important. Consider requesting focused training sessions or pairing with a technical mentor who can explain concepts in practical terms.

**Establishing Boundaries**: Your goal of "leaving work at work" reflects wisdom about sustainable performance. Develop simple routines like closing your laptop at a specific time or taking a few minutes to decompress before going home.

## Enhancing Your Flow Experience

Your Flow Score of 37 indicates you experience flow occasionally but face barriers to consistent engagement. This is common for coordinators who often work in reactive modes.

### Creating Better Flow Conditions

**Structured Focus Time**: Block calendar time for planning and organizing work. Use this time for the detailed coordination tasks that require concentration.

**Clear Communication Routines**: Establish regular check-ins with team members so you can anticipate needs rather than always responding to urgent requests.
