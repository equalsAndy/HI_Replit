## Step-by-Step Reflection

### Planning Strength (37.5%)
**How and when do you use your Planning strength?**

I use my planning strength when creating structured project plans that enable team success. Like in my agile certification program they taught us about creating clear roadmaps and I try to follow those methodologies. I spend a lot of time making sure everyone knows their deadlines and dependencies are mapped out properly. Sometimes I worry im being too detailed but I think having everything organized really helps prevent chaos later. The scrum master approach we learned really resonates with me and I try to apply those frameworks to keep projects on track.

### Feeling Strength (34.8%)
**How and when do you use your Feeling strength?**

My feeling strength helps me support team members and understand when theyre stressed or confused about requirements. I notice when people seem overwhelmed in meetings and try to follow up with them afterwards. Im still learning how to balance being supportive with maintaining professional boundaries though because sometimes I say yes to too many requests. I think building empathy while being more confident about saying no is something I really want to improve. I care a lot about making sure everyone feels heard and included in the planning process.

### Acting Strength (17.2%)
**How and when do you use your Acting strength?**

I use my acting strength when deadlines are tight and we need to coordinate quickly between teams. Even though its not my strongest area I can step up and make decisions when needed. Like when our team was behind on deliverables I took initiative to reorganize our sprint board and reached out to stakeholders directly. Im working on being more confident about taking action without second guessing myself so much. I think with more experience ill get better at trusting my instincts and moving forward even when I dont have all the information.

### Thinking Strength (10.5%)
**How and when do you use your Thinking strength?**

My thinking strength comes in handy when I need to analyze project risks or figure out why processes arent working. Im still developing this but I try to look at the data and identify patterns in our project metrics. In my project management classes we learned about root cause analysis and I use those techniques when troubleshooting issues. I think I could get better at strategic thinking and seeing the bigger picture beyond just the immediate tasks. Working with more experienced PMs has shown me how much more analytical depth I can develop.

### Team Environment Values
**What you value most in team environments**

I value teams that have clear processes and supportive communication. I really appreciate when teams take time to explain context and help newer members learn instead of just assuming we know everything. I think psychological safety is super important so people feel comfortable asking questions or admitting when theyre confused. I also value when teams use good project management tools and keep documentation updated because it helps everyone stay aligned. Teams that balance structure with flexibility work best for me because I like having frameworks to follow but also need room to adapt when requirements change.

### Unique Contribution
**Your unique contribution to teams**

I hope I bring reliable organization and genuine care for project success. Im working on being more confident about my contributions but I think I help teams by making sure nothing falls through the cracks and everyone feels supported. My combination of planning skills and empathy means I can create structures that actually work for people instead of just processes that look good on paper. I try to be the person who remembers to check in on teammates and make sure deliverables are properly coordinated. I think as I gain more experience ill be able to contribute more strategic thinking too.

## Cantril Ladder Assessment

### Current Well-being Level: 6/10
### Future Well-being Level (1 year): 8/10

### Current Factors
What factors shape your current rating?

My current wellbeing is shaped by having meaningful work that uses my organizational skills and lets me help people. I feel good when I can create clear project plans and see teams succeed. Having supportive colleagues who are patient with my questions really helps too. Im fortunate to have good health and stable finances but I do struggle with imposter syndrome sometimes. I worry about making mistakes or not being experienced enough which creates stress. The hybrid work model works well for my planning style but I sometimes feel disconnected from senior team members who might be able to mentor me.

### Future Improvements
What improvements do you envision?

In one year I want to feel much more confident in my project management abilities and not second guess myself as much. I envision having stronger professional relationships with my colleagues and feeling like a valued team member rather than just the new person. I want to have better work life boundaries so im not constantly checking slack or worrying about whether I did something wrong. Id love to be recognized as someone who can handle complex coordination tasks independently and maybe even mentor other new hires. Having clearer career progression and growth opportunities would make a huge difference in my satisfaction.

### Specific Changes
What will be different?

Ill have more autonomy in managing projects without needing constant approval or validation from supervisors. My confidence in meetings will be much higher and ill speak up more often with ideas or concerns. I want to have established better boundaries around working hours and not feel guilty about logging off at reasonable times. Hopefully ill have completed some advanced PM certifications and feel more credible when discussing methodology with senior team members. My stress levels should be lower because ill trust my abilities more and have better systems for managing competing priorities.

### Quarterly Progress
What progress would you expect in 3 months?

Ill have successfully managed at least one medium complexity project end to end with minimal oversight. I should feel more comfortable asking questions in team meetings and pushing back when timelines seem unrealistic. I want to have established regular check ins with my manager to discuss career development. My project documentation and communication should be getting positive feedback from stakeholders. I hope to have identified a mentor within the company who can guide my professional growth.

### Quarterly Actions
What actions will you commit to this quarter?

I will schedule bi weekly one on ones with my manager to discuss growth opportunities and get feedback on my performance. Im going to sign up for an advanced agile certification course to build my credibility and skills. I want to volunteer for a cross functional project that will let me work with other departments and expand my network. Ill also set clearer boundaries by turning off work notifications after 7pm and not checking email on weekends. Finally ill start documenting my wins and accomplishments so I can advocate for myself better during reviews.

## Future Self Reflection

### Where do you see yourself in 5, 10, and 20 years?

In 5 years I want to be a senior project manager leading complex technical initiatives and maybe managing a small team of coordinators. I hope to be known for creating efficient processes that teams actually want to follow instead of just compliance requirements. In 10 years id love to be a program manager overseeing multiple projects and mentoring junior PMs. I think about maybe getting my PMP certification and speaking at project management conferences. In 20 years I could see myself as a VP of operations or transformation leading organizational change initiatives. I want to be someone who builds great teams and helps companies scale effectively while maintaining good culture.

### What does your life look like when optimized for flow?

When optimized for flow id have clear project management systems that let me organize complex work without constant stress. My calendar would have dedicated blocks for deep planning work and time for team collaboration. Id work with managers who give clear direction but trust me to execute independently. The tools and processes would be well designed so I can focus on coordination rather than fighting with systems. Id have strong professional relationships where I feel comfortable asking questions and sharing ideas. My workload would be challenging but manageable so I can deliver quality results without burning out.

### Additional thoughts and reflections

I think my biggest growth area is building confidence in my professional judgment. I have solid technical skills from my education but translating that to real world project management takes time and practice. I want to get better at having difficult conversations when projects are off track instead of just hoping things work out. Learning to balance my natural empathy with the need to hold people accountable for deliverables is something im still figuring out. I also want to develop more strategic thinking skills so I can contribute to higher level planning discussions. Overall im excited about growing into a leadership role where I can use my organizational strengths to help teams succeed.

## Final Reflection

### Letter to Future Self

Hey future me! Hopefully by the time you read this youve figured out how to be more confident in meetings and stopped worrying so much about whether everyone likes you. I hope youve learned that asking good questions actually makes you look smart not stupid. Remember that your planning skills and care for people are real strengths even when you feel like you dont know what youre doing. Keep being curious and dont be afraid to volunteer for stretch assignments that feel a little scary. Trust that your thorough approach and genuine desire to help teams succeed will take you far. And please tell me you finally learned how to say no to requests that arent aligned with your priorities!

The workshop helped me realize that my combination of planning and feeling strengths is actually pretty unique and valuable for teams. I want to remember that being organized and empathetic isnt boring its exactly what chaotic projects need. Stop comparing yourself to the super confident PMs and focus on developing your own leadership style. Your future is bright!
