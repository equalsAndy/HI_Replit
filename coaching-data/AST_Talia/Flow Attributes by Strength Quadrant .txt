This is a list of Flow Attributes by Strength Quadrant

- Flow attributes are chosen from a list without users knowing the quadrant mapping
- The percentages are just for ranking, not statistical meaning 
- The relationship between chosen flow attributes and strength quadrants can be interesting to note
- There's more to learn about how to discuss these patterns appropriately

What's particularly interesting is comparing their chosen flow attributes to their strength quadrant percentages. If I understand correctly, we might notice patterns like:
- Someone with high Thinking strengths choosing flow attributes that map to Thinking
- Or perhaps interesting mismatches where their flow state comes from a different quadrant than their dominant strengths
