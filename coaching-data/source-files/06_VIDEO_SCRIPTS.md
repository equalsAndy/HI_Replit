## Video 1: Introduction to Talia and Team Lion

### Setting: Documentary-style introduction
**Narrator**: At SelfActual, we are reimagining how individuals, teams, and organizations unlock their full potential. I'd like to introduce you to Talia, our AI-powered guide, coach, and trusted advisor. Talia is designed to help people and organizations be their best by promoting personal, team, and organizational growth, providing actionable insights, fostering engagement, and ensuring alignment at every level.

**Narrator**: Talia is more than just an AI tool—she has super powers that help guide us through ALL kinds of issues and opportunities we humans face at work.

**Narrator**: We'll come back to Talia later. Now let's meet Team Lion–the group that implements the company's Zoo Administration software for zoos around the world.

**Narrator**: We'll see how a workshop helps them understand themselves and creates data that Talia can use to help everyone.

[Team introductions with Star Cards displayed]

**Narrator**: Last quarter, the team had some challenges. Sam, can you explain?

**Sam**: Of course. The team was facing challenges in communication and collaboration. As the company grew, project demands strained our communication. Client expectations added new stress points and everyone seemed misaligned.

**Sam**: I enrolled the team in a wonderful workshop called All Star Teams, which is where we met Talia for the first time.

**Sam**: In the first part of the workshop, we learned individually about our thinking, feeling, acting and planning strengths as well as our all-important imagination.

**Sam**: All of it went on to Star Cards for sharing with each other.

**Sam**: I enjoyed thinking about what puts me into my "flow state" and how that related to my strengths.

**Sam**: Having it all on my Star Card would help me and the team put all of our individual work into a team context.

**Sam**: Back together again for the "team module", Talia helped us share our reflections and our star cards. How our strengths and flow states balanced and worked together was eye opening.

**Sam**: This and the rest of the work in the module not only helped us understand each other, but it helped Talia learn more about us as individuals, as a team, and as part of Lion Software.

**Narrator**: That's right! Thank you Sam! Maria, José, would you share what happened next?

**Maria**: Well, we finished the workshop, and everyone seemed to know each other better.

**Maria**: A LOT better! We felt like more of a team. Everyone was... I mean is... much more comfortable talking through things as they came up. Right, José?

**Jose**: Yes, we were ALOT more comfortable talking through things. We agreed on our purpose, our goals, and how our strengths balance each other. Even Aliya, who is usually pretty shy, stepped up to lead a project.

**Sam**: After the workshop, I let the team know that Talia would continue to help us with our work or with personal questions, if we wanted.

## Video 2: Digital Self Vaults

### Setting: Continuation of Team Lion story
**Narrator**: OK, Team Lion. You all got a lot out of the AllStarTeams workshop, right? What happened next?

**Aliya**: I was on my way home and I got to thinking about what everyone said. I remembered that they said Talia was always available so I thought I'd ask her something that's been on my mind but I've been too embarrassed to ask.

**Talia**: Hi, Aliya! Your support with scheduling and documentation is critical to keeping the team aligned. For this week, you could help by organizing a feedback session with the client to ensure Team Lion is meeting their needs. You might also meet one on one with Jose, Maria, and Sam to ask about other ways to help the team.

**Narrator**: That's so interesting! So with only the data from the workshop, Talia could give you some immediate help that played to your strengths. Did anyone else use Talia right out of the box?

**Narrator**: Ok, Jose.

**Jose**: I started to type in questions but I was concerned about other people seeing my data, my personal thoughts, and my conversations. So I asked Talia who could see my information.

**Talia**: Great question, José! You own and control your personal vault completely. Think of it like your own private space. Workshop insights, personal goals, feedback, your thoughts on the feedback - that all stays in your vault unless you want to share it.

**Talia**: Here, I'll show you how it works! When Team Lion started their All Star Teams workshops, we created a Digital Self Vault for you and each of the other team members.

**Talia**: As you worked through the exercises, the data you created, including your strengths & flow, goals, and future-looking thoughts, went into your vault. And so did everyone else's. These are your Digital Self Vaults.

**Jose**: What is a Digital Self Vault?

**Talia**: The idea is pretty simple. You own your vault. You control the data, and I help you manage it. The more of the real you, you put in, the more I get to know you. The more I know you, the better I can help you personally and professionally. But don't worry, I won't share any of it unless you tell me it's ok.

**Jose**: Are you saying my company doesn't see anything?

**Talia**: No, that's not quite it. You and Lion Software both get some information from the workshop like your strengths and flow. Those things help the company better understand their workforce balance and how their teams are working.

**Talia**: Things like your professional goals, or your hopes, fears, and opinions can be shared according to YOUR rules. You can keep it all private, share it, or share it anonymized and aggregated so it can help the team the organization or, well, you.

**Jose**: That's really cool!

**Narrator**: I'm with José! That's really neat! The organization benefits from what the team shares with it, The team itself has ongoing post-workshop support, and each team member has access to an AI companion that they can trust because they control their data. AND it gets to know them better with each interaction. Sounds like a win-win-win to me!

**Narrator**: Next time, we'll talk about what happens when we connect more data sources to the connected vaults we just talked about.

## Video 3: Talia's Growing Capabilities

### Setting: Fireside chat format
[Scene: A warmly lit room with two comfortable chairs arranged near a fireplace. The Narrator sits in one chair, while Talia appears in the other. The lighting is intimate but professional.]

**Narrator**: We've seen how you help teams like Team Lion work better together. But I'm curious about how your capabilities grow as you gather more data. Could you walk us through that journey?

**Talia**: Of course! Let's start with a single person – actually, let's use Maria from Team Lion as an example.

[Visual: Split screen showing Maria completing her self-assessment]

**Talia**: When Maria first did her self-assessment and Module 1, I learned about her strengths, her flow states, and how she envisions her future self. Even with just that initial data, I could help her identify optimal working conditions and suggest ways to apply her strengths.

**Narrator**: Can you give us a specific example?

**Talia**: Sure. When Maria mentioned feeling stuck on a project, I could remind her that her Star Card showed strong visualization skills. I suggested she try sketching out the problem instead of writing about it. That small insight helped unlock her thinking.

**Narrator**: Then what happens when an entire team goes through the workshops?

**Talia**: That's when things get really interesting! With Team Lion, once everyone completed both modules, I could see patterns in their collective strengths and potential blind spots. Remember how José was concerned about sharing data?

**Narrator**: Yes, he was quite protective of his personal information.

**Talia**: Exactly. And that's why the vault system is so important. I could help the team work better together without exposing anyone's private information. For instance, I noticed that while Maria excels at visualizing solutions, José is brilliant at implementing them. I could suggest collaboration opportunities without revealing their personal reflections.

**Narrator**: And when multiple teams complete the workshops?

**Talia**: That's when I start recognizing broader patterns. For instance, at Lion Software, I began noticing that teams with a mix of planning and acting strengths tend to deliver projects faster. But I also saw that they sometimes skip important documentation steps.

**Narrator**: Then the organization adds their data?

**Talia**: Yes, and this is transformative. When Lion Software added their core values, policies, and strategic goals to their organizational vault, I could help align individual growth with company direction.

**Narrator**: How does that work in practice?

**Talia**: Let me share a recent example. When Lion Software added their core value of "Innovation Through Collaboration," I could suggest cross-team projects based on complementary strengths I'd observed. But I always respect privacy – I only connect people based on skills and interests they've chosen to share.

**Narrator**: And then executive data comes into play?

**Talia**: The executive vault is fascinating because it lets leaders safely explore strategic possibilities. When Sam, as VP, was considering a new mobile initiative, I could confidentially analyze skill gaps between current team capabilities and future needs – all while protecting individual privacy.

**Narrator**: Finally, you mentioned tactical data?

**Talia**: Yes, when organizations add project data, resource allocations, and concrete goals, I can make increasingly sophisticated connections. For instance, I recently helped Lion Software staff a new project by identifying team members whose growth goals aligned with the project's needs – but only using information they'd explicitly agreed to share.

**Narrator**: It sounds like trust is central to everything you do.

**Talia**: Absolutely. Every insight I provide is based on carefully managed permissions and user consent. The more people trust me with their data, the more I can help them grow – but always on their terms.

**Narrator**: Thank you, Talia. Next time, we'll explore how this trust-based system is transforming workplace culture.
