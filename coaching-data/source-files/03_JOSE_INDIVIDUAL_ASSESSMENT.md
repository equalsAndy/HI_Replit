## Talia Interaction History

### Initial Privacy Concerns
Jose was the first team member to express concerns about data privacy, asking directly: "I was concerned about other people seeing my data, my personal thoughts, and my conversations. So I asked Talia who could see my information."

### Privacy Resolution
This led to Talia's explanation of the Digital Self Vault system, where Jose learned:
- Complete ownership and control of personal vault
- Company sees only shared professional information
- User controls all sharing permissions
- Privacy maintained while enabling team and organizational benefits

### Post-Workshop Engagement
After understanding the privacy framework, Jose became comfortable using Talia for professional development questions and team collaboration support.
