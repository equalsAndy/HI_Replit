## How to Use This Package

1. **Verify Data Quality**: Check 01-raw-database-query.json to ensure all user data was retrieved
2. **Check Transformation**: Compare 02 and 03 to see how data is reformatted
3. **Review AI Input**: See 03 to understand exactly what OpenAI receives
4. **Analyze AI Output**: Read 04 to see the raw generated content and 04b for statistics
5. **Inspect Final HTML**: Open 05 in a browser to see the rendered report
6. **Debug Issues**: Compare files to find where data might be lost or transformed incorrectly

## Key Metrics

- **OpenAI Response Length**: 11797 characters
- **OpenAI Word Count**: 1 words
- **HTML Size**: 239665 characters
- **Generation Time**: Check timestamps in files

## Expected vs Actual

### Expected (Good Report)
- OpenAI Response: 5000+ words (15000+ characters)
- HTML Size: 50000+ characters
- Generation Time: 15-30 seconds

### Actual (This Report)
- OpenAI Response: 1 words
- HTML Size: 239665 characters

## Troubleshooting

If report is too short:
1. Check 03-transformer-output-to-openai.json - Is all data present?
2. Check 04-raw-openai-response.txt - Did OpenAI generate enough content?
3. If OpenAI response is short, check the Assistant instructions in OpenAI dashboard
4. Consider adjusting max_tokens or model in openai-api-service.ts

If data is missing:
1. Check 01-raw-database-query.json - Was all data retrieved?
2. Check 02-transformer-input.json - Was data properly structured?
3. Check 03-transformer-output-to-openai.json - Was data preserved through transformation?
