# AllStarTeams & Imaginal Agility Workshop Platform

## Overview

This is a dual-application learning platform built with React, Express, and PostgreSQL that hosts two distinct workshop experiences:

1. **AllStarTeams Workshop** - Team collaboration and strengths discovery
2. **Imaginal Agility Workshop** - Individual development and agility training

The platform provides a guided, step-by-step learning experience with assessments, reflections, and personalized reports. Users progress through sequential modules with content including videos, interactive assessments, and self-reflection exercises.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite for development
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with Radix UI components for consistent design
- **State Management**: React hooks and context for local state, TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter library for client-side routing
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives

### Backend Architecture  
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with cookie-based authentication
- **File Structure**: Modular API routes with service layer separation

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Schema**: Comprehensive user management, assessment tracking, and progress persistence
- **Key Tables**: users, user_assessments, invites, applications, discernment_scenarios, user_discernment_progress

3. Session-based authentication persists login state
4. Navigation progress tracks user's current position in workshop

### Workshop Progression
1. Users start at step 1-1 and progress sequentially
2. Video steps require minimal engagement to unlock next step
3. Assessment steps block progression until completed
4. Results stored in user_assessments table with JSON schema
5. Navigation progress updated in real-time

### Assessment & Reporting
1. User completes interactive assessments (modal-based UI)
2. Responses validated and stored as JSON in database
3. Calculation engines generate scores and insights
4. Visual reports generated (star cards, charts) using assessment data
5. AI-powered comprehensive reports synthesize all user data
