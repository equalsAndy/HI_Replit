# Holistic Report Data Flow Debug Package

## Overview
This package contains the exact data flow for holistic report generation for user 65 (Millie Millie) on 2025-09-25.

## Files in Order

### 1. `1-transformer-input.json`
**What:** Raw export data sent TO the transformer
**Source:** Database rows parsed and structured by holistic-report-routes.ts
**Format:** Object with userInfo and assessments (object format, not array)
**Key Features:**
- User reflections preserved exactly as written
- Assessment data organized by type (starCard, flowAssessment, etc.)
- May contain legitimate assessment terminology like "MBTI", "planning", etc.

### 2. `2-transformer-output.json`
**What:** Clean, structured data that comes OUT of the transformer
**Source:** transformExportToAssistantInput() function result
**Format:** AssistantInput interface with standardized fields
**Key Features:**
- Strengths categorized into leading/supporting/quieter
- Flow data combines scores with reflection text
- All reflection text preserved
- Validation passed (no gibberish detected)

### 3. `3-openai-input.json`
**What:** Exact JSON message that WOULD be sent to OpenAI
**Source:** generateOpenAIReport() function (before legacy check failure)
**Format:** ast_input_v2 envelope with payload
**Status:** **BLOCKED** by legacy marker validation
**Key Issue:** Legacy check prevents this from reaching OpenAI

### 4. `4-fallback-response.json`
**What:** What the system actually returned (not from OpenAI)
**Source:** Admin-style template fallback
**Length:** 561 characters (much shorter than expected)
**Type:** Basic HTML template with data substitution
**Issue:** No AI analysis, just data display

### 5. `5-expected-openai-response.json`
**What:** What SHOULD come back from OpenAI if successful
**Expected Length:** 5,000-15,000 characters
**Format:** Structured markdown with deep analysis
**Status:** Currently blocked

## Current Issue

**Problem:** Legacy marker validation in `generateOpenAIReport()` line 821 prevents OpenAI call

**Code Location:**
```javascript
const legacy = /TALIA|PRIMARY_Prompt|MBTI|DISC|Clifton/i;
if (legacy.test(inputStr)) {
  throw new Error("Legacy/TALIA markers detected in input. Remove all legacy references.");
}
```

**Root Cause:** The `skipLegacyCheck` flag is either:
1. Not properly set to `true`
2. Not being applied correctly
3. Being overridden somewhere

**Solution Needed:** Properly disable the legacy marker check for report generation since user reflections may legitimately contain assessment terminology.

## Data Quality

‚úÖ **Transformation Pipeline:** Working perfectly
‚úÖ **User Data:** High quality reflections, complete assessments
‚úÖ **Data Structure:** Correct object format (not array)
‚ùå **OpenAI Call:** Blocked by validation
‚ùå **Final Output:** Fallback template instead of AI analysis

## Next Steps

1. Fix the `skipLegacyCheck` logic in `generateOpenAIReport()`
2. Ensure user reflection content doesn't trigger legacy validation
3. Test with a successful OpenAI call to capture the full response
4. Update this package with the actual OpenAI response data

## Log Evidence

Key log entries showing the issue:
- `üîç [TRANSFORMER] assessments type: OBJECT ‚úÖ` - Transformation working
- `‚ùå OpenAI report generation failed: Legacy/TALIA markers detected` - Validation failing
- `‚úÖ Admin-style report generated successfully (561 chars)` - Fallback activated
