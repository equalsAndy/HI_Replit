    "reflections": {
      "strength1": "Acting helps me step into situations where quick movement is needed. I've learned that even small steps forward can create momentum, and I'm comfortable making decisions without having all the information. This strength shows up when projects are stalled or when someone needs to take the first step.",
      "strength2": "Planning shows up when I map out steps to turn an idea into action. I enjoy creating checklists and timelines that help me see the path forward. This strength is most valuable when I can break down complex goals into manageable pieces.",
      "strength3": "Thinking doesn't come as naturally, but I still rely on it when weighing trade-offs. Sometimes I ask questions that help the group slow down and consider different angles. I've learned to pause before acting when the stakes are higher.",
      "strength4": "I often use my Feeling strength to sense the mood of the group and check in when energy drops. This helps me know when to pivot approaches or when someone might need extra support. I notice when team dynamics shift and can address it.",
      "teamValues": "I value honesty in communication even when feedback is difficult. A culture where people feel safe to share concerns early prevents bigger problems later. I also value follow-through - when we commit to something as a team, I want us to deliver on it.",
      "uniqueContribution": "I bring warmth and structure together. People know I will listen carefully, but also ensure the work gets done. I help bridge the gap between big ideas and practical next steps, making sure good intentions turn into results.",
      "flowNatural": "Flow happens when I'm brainstorming with others and then immediately capturing the ideas into a concrete plan. The combination of creative energy and organized follow-up feels natural to me.",
      "flowBlockers": "My flow breaks down when roles aren't clear, and everyone is talking past each other. I also find it hard to get into flow when I'm working on something that feels disconnected from the bigger picture.",
      "flowConditions": "I work best when I know the end goal but have freedom in how to get there. A clear structure with flexibility within it helps me find my rhythm.",
      "flowOpportunities": "I could create more opportunities for flow by setting up short idea-sharing sessions followed by planning time. I also want to get better at protecting focused work time when I need to dive deep into implementation."

      "futureImprovements": "To get to an 8, I'd want more autonomy in how I structure my work and clearer pathways for growth. I'd also like to feel more confident in my strategic thinking abilities.",
      "specificChanges": "I want to take on more project leadership roles and develop stronger skills in long-term planning. I'd also like to build more expertise in areas where I currently defer to others.",
