**API Endpoints**:
- GET: `/api/workshop-data/flow-attributes`
- POST: `/api/workshop-data/flow-attributes`

### Purpose
Flow attributes describe **how you work at your best** when in flow state. They complement your Star strengths profile (which shows **what** you're naturally good at) to create a complete picture of your professional identity for team collaboration.

### Selection Instructions
**Prompt**: "Add Flow to Your Star Card - Select four flow attributes that best describe your optimal flow state. These will be added to your StarCard."

**Example Statement**: "I find myself in flow when I am being: Dynamic, Punctual, Receptive, Encouraging"

### The 56 Flow Attributes

**Thinking Quadrant (14 attributes):**
- Abstract, Analytic, Astute, Big Picture, Curious
- Focused, Insightful, Logical, Investigative, Rational
- Reflective, Sensible, Strategic, Thoughtful

**Feeling Quadrant (12 attributes):**
- Collaborative, Creative, Encouraging, Expressive
- Empathic, Intuitive, Inspiring, Objective, Passionate
- Positive, Receptive, Supportive

**Planning Quadrant (14 attributes):**
- Detail-Oriented, Diligent, Immersed, Industrious, Methodical
- Organized, Precise, Punctual, Reliable, Responsible
- Straightforward, Tidy, Systematic, Thorough

**Acting Quadrant (16 attributes):**
- Adventuresome, Competitive, Dynamic, Effortless, Energetic
- Engaged, Funny, Persuasive, Open-Minded, Optimistic
- Practical, Resilient, Spontaneous, Vigorous

### Database Storage Structure
```typescript
// Stored in flow_attributes table
{
  id: serial,
  userId: number,
  attributes: [
    { "name": "Dynamic", "order": 1 },
    { "name": "Punctual", "order": 2 },
    { "name": "Receptive", "order": 3 },
    { "name": "Encouraging", "order": 4 }
  ],
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}
```

### Selection Rules
- **Exactly 4 attributes** must be selected
- Attributes must be **ranked 1-4** (order matters for display)
- Users can reorder via drag-and-drop interface
- Attributes are editable until workshop completion
- Appears on StarCard visualization

### Integration with StarCard
Selected flow attributes are displayed on the user's StarCard alongside their strength percentages, providing a comprehensive professional profile that shows both **what they're good at** (strengths) and **how they work at their best** (flow attributes).

### UI Interaction Pattern
1. User completes 12-question flow assessment
2. User views flow score and interpretation
3. User selects 4 flow attribute words from categorized list
4. User can drag-and-drop to reorder selected attributes
5. Selected attributes save to database and appear on StarCard
6. User can edit attributes by clicking "Edit Attributes" button
