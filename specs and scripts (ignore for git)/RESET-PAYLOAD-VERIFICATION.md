# Reset Payload Verification

**Date**: January 2025
**Status**: ✅ Verified

## Question
Does resetting report generation from admin console also delete the previous payload data?

## Answer: YES ✅

The `resetUserHolisticReports()` method in `user-management-service.ts` correctly deletes all report data including payloads.

### What Gets Deleted

**1. report_sections table** (line 1093):
```sql
DELETE FROM report_sections WHERE user_id = ${userId}
```

This deletes the **entire row** including:
- ✅ `section_id`
- ✅ `section_name`
- ✅ `section_title`
- ✅ `section_content` (generated HTML/text)
- ✅ `raw_content` (raw OpenAI response)
- ✅ `ai_request_payload` (complete v2.3 structured payload) **← This is what you asked about**
- ✅ `status`
- ✅ `error_message`
- ✅ All timestamps and metadata

**2. holistic_reports table** (line 1109):
```sql
DELETE FROM holistic_reports WHERE user_id = ${userId}
```

### What Gets Preserved

✅ User assessments (`user_assessments` table)
✅ Workshop data (`workshop_step_data` table - if used)
✅ Flow attributes (`flow_attributes` table - if used)
✅ User profile data

### Reset Flow

1. Admin clicks "Reset Reports" in admin console
2. `DELETE /api/admin/users/:id/reports` endpoint called
3. `resetUserHolisticReports()` executes:
   - Deletes all `report_sections` rows (including payloads)
   - Deletes all `holistic_reports` rows
   - Returns count of deleted records
4. User can regenerate reports with fresh payloads

### Console Output

When reset executes, you'll see:
```
🗑️ Starting report reset for user 76 (deletes all report data, preserves user assessments)
✅ Deleted 5 report section(s) from report_sections table
✅ Deleted 1 final report(s) from holistic_reports table
✅ Report reset complete for user 76: 6 total records deleted (1 final reports, 5 sections)
ℹ️ User assessments and workshop data preserved - user can regenerate reports
```

## Verification

To verify payloads are deleted:

```sql
-- Before reset
SELECT section_id, ai_request_payload IS NOT NULL as has_payload
FROM report_sections
WHERE user_id = 76;

-- After reset
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM report_sections WHERE user_id = 76;
-- Returns: 0
```

## Conclusion

✅ **Reset functionality is correct** - it completely removes all old payload data
✅ **No manual cleanup needed** - payloads are deleted automatically with the row
✅ **Safe to regenerate** - fresh reports will have new payloads with updated data
